#!/usr/bin/env bash
# concurrency_repro.sh — reproduces the UPSTREAM concurrent-HTTP-response
# corruption (a cyrius/sandhi core thread-safety bug, NOT a probe bug).
#
# Under high concurrent load (~300 simultaneous requests), cyrius/sandhi corrupt
# ~3% of HTTP responses with cross-field byte interleaving — e.g. the /api/health
# body `{"status":"ok","service":"yeo-cy-test","version":"0.1.0"}` comes back as
# `{"ctatye":"-t","servire":"yeo.c1.0est",...}` (bytes of "yeo-cy-test" and
# "0.1.0" spliced together). This is INDEPENDENT of patra: /api/health touches no
# DB, no route params, and no app lock — it just builds a tiny static JSON via
# the probe's resp_json (json_v_build → str_builder) and sandhi's
# sandhi_server_send_response_c. Every layer (alloc/default_alloc, str_builder,
# json_v) is individually per-call and bottoms out at the CAS-locked alloc(), yet
# concurrent responses share overlapping memory — so the race is in the cyrius
# core alloc/build path under contention. It makes the probe's concurrency
# scenarios (verify.py 4/8/10) intermittently flaky.
#
# Filed upstream (cyrius/sandhi). This script is a diagnostic, NOT a pass/fail
# gate — it is EXPECTED to show corruption until the upstream bug is fixed.
#
# Usage:  ./build.sh && tests/concurrency_repro.sh   (server auto-started)
