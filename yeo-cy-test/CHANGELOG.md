## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — test harnesses can no longer test a stale server
- **`tests/verify.py`** tracks every server it starts and reaps them on *any* exit
  (`atexit`, plus SIGTERM → normal exit), refuses to start when :8080/:8443 are already
  bound, and asserts its own child is still alive after `wait_ready()`. Before, a run that
  died mid-suite left its server running; the next run's health check was answered by that
  stale process while the new child died on bind, so scenarios 12a–c and 21 failed against
  the wrong server and read like regressions (seen during the 6.6.6 refresh — FINDINGS
  2026-09-25).
- **`tests/ui_check.mjs`** applies the same busy-port refusal, kills its server on any
  process exit, and awaits the server's exit instead of racing it with `process.exit()`.
  **`tests/concurrency_repro.sh`** gains the port check and an `EXIT` trap.
- Verified: full suite green (9 + 48 + 13) with nothing left running afterwards; a run that
  crashes mid-suite now reaps its server; with a stale server bound, both harnesses exit 1
  in ~65 ms naming the cause, and leave the stale process untouched.

### Changed — toolchain + deps refresh: cyrius 6.4.64 → 6.6.6 (two source fixes, both caught at build)
- **Pins** (2026-09-25): cyrius **6.4.64 → 6.6.6**; sandhi **1.9.0 → 1.10.0**, sakshi
  **2.4.6 → 2.5.5**, patra **1.12.10 → 1.15.0**, libro **2.8.1 → 2.10.3**, ai-hwaccel
  **2.3.14 → 2.4.0**. Every one of those releases pins cyrius 6.6.6, so they move together.
- **`json_v_parse_str` → `json_v_parse_buf`** (4 call sites). bayan 1.3.0 (cyrius 6.5.0)
  renamed the `(ptr, len)` JSON parse entry point; 6.6.6 refuses to emit a binary with a
  reachable undefined fn (6.5.x only warned and lowered the call to `ud2` — a runtime
  SIGILL). Bodies are byte-identical upstream — a pure rename.
- **`http_body_ptr` / `http_body_len` → `req_body_ptr` / `req_body_len`.** sandhi 1.10.0's
  `sandhi-server.deps` sidecar brings stdlib `http` into scope, whose 1-arg
  `http_body_len(resp)` collided with the probe's 2-arg request accessor; cyrius 6.6 makes a
  same-name/different-arity duplicate a hard error (it used to be last-definition-wins).
- **What the bump buys:** patra's S0 data-integrity fixes (a B+ tree split that silently
  lost indexed rows; `patra_begin` now reports a WAL-open failure instead of running a
  transaction with no undo log; per-database WAL state); cyrius 6.6.0's zero-allocation
  value-form `Result`; and **one sigil everywhere** — see FINDINGS (2026-09-25): at 6.4.64,
  libro's sigil 3.11.1 thin bundles silently replaced 226 functions of the toolchain's sigil
  3.12.0 (incl. `ed25519_*`/SHA-256); both now resolve to sigil **3.12.18**.
- Frontend emit unchanged (`web/app.js` byte-identical under the 6.6.6 emitter). Suite:
  **9 unit + 48 backend + 13 full-stack UI**, green on both the 6.4.64 baseline and 6.6.6.

### Changed — honest port-standing assessment; the probe's own overclaims retracted
- **Measured the gap instead of narrating it** (2026-07-14). The probe is **~879 LOC of
  module code against sy-core's 60,425** (243 `.rs`, 22 module dirs) — **~1.5% written**.
  The five shared module *names* are thin slices at 16–23% fidelity, not ports: **`tee` ≈
  0%** (sy-core seals under `KeySource{Tpm,Sgx,Keyring}`; the probe has one HKDF KEK from an
  env var with an insecure dev fallback — which is how the tests run), **`auth`** is 541 LOC
  / 3 routes vs 3,396 / 40 with one hardcoded credential and no user store, **`crypto`** is
  ~4 of 13 public fns (no X25519/DH), and only **`audit`** is a fair 1:1 (~20%). **2 of the
  probe's 15 routes** map to real sy-core endpoints (15 of 540 = 2.8%). **`notes` is invented
  scaffolding** — 2 of 243 `.rs` files, as a `notes: Option<String>` column — yet it owns 5
  routes and the whole frontend.
- **Retracted README's "Now growing into the real port. Five `sy-core` modules are ported
  in"** — the probe's own overclaim, and the register the module narratives were written in.
  Replaced with the measured standing; the list is now framed as *seams exercised*.
  `docs/development/state.md` gains a "Where the port actually stands" section (the numbers
  supersede the narratives below it).
- **What breaks first in a real port: the schema.** Zero `.sql` / `sqlx::migrate!` in
  `crates/`; the authoritative **208-table / 7,845-LOC** migration set lives in
  `packages/core` — the package the roadmap deletes in the same clause as the Cyrius port.
  Behind it: patra has 3 column types, no `ON CONFLICT` (sy-core uses 14), no parsed
  `RETURNING` (157). *(Checked and dismissed: "patra has no JOIN" — sy-core's db layer has
  2 JOINs. Not a blocker.)* **`brain` has no target at all** — `mneme`/`hoosh`/`daimon` ship
  0 dist bundles (applications, not libs). WebAuthn/OIDC/PKCE: zero ecosystem-wide.
  ~**88% of remaining work is blocked on ecosystem construction, not porting**; ~6% mechanical.
- **Corrected a third over-filed gap: "no Cyrius TEE/TPM API" is false.** sigil ships
  `tpm_seal_data`/`tpm_unseal_data` (`src/tpm.cyr:81,88`) and `sgx_derive_seal_key`
  (`src/seal.cyr:122,170`). The real, narrower gap is that its TPM path **shells out to
  tpm2-tools** — the exec surface this probe deliberately avoids (`hwprobe` uses
  `registry_detect_no_exec()` for exactly that reason). **Pattern, not incident:** three
  filings this cycle ("no Argon2", "memory-amplifying DoS ~19 MiB/attempt", "no TEE/TPM API")
  all read worse than reality because they were reasoned from docs/design rather than
  measured against the source. Recorded in FINDINGS as the finding.
- No code change; tests unaffected (**9 unit + 48 backend + 13 full-stack UI**, green).

### Added — per-IP login rate limiting (closes the DoS this probe opened; the sandhi ask shipped)
- **`/api/login` is now per-IP rate limited** — a token bucket (5/min, burst 5; tunable via
  `SY_LOGIN_BURST` / `SY_LOGIN_REFILL_MS` with production-safe defaults), checked **before**
  the concurrency cap so a limited attempt costs ~nothing. Argon2id made login cost ~244 ms
  of CPU; scenario 20's concurrency cap stopped a burst from starving the 4-worker pool, but
  one source could still grind 2 workers indefinitely. Bounding **sustained** attempts needs
  the client address — which is exactly the gap this probe filed against sandhi.
- **Full arc, one cycle:** probe finding → **sandhi 1.9.0** (`sandhi_server_conn_peer_ip`,
  via `getpeername(2)`, over both the plaintext and TLS seams) → folded in **cyrius 6.4.64**
  → adopted here. `[deps.sandhi]` 1.8.2 → **1.9.0**; cyrius pin 6.4.63 → **6.4.64**.
- **The limiter can't be turned into a vector itself:** fixed 64-slot table with LRU
  eviction, so spraying source addresses evicts the sprayer rather than growing memory,
  while a sustained single source stays pinned and stays limited. Milli-token integer math
  (no floats); serialized by a mutex whose critical section is microseconds against
  Argon2id's 244 ms.
- **Verified (scenario 21)** at burst=3: `127.0.0.1` × 6 → **3 allowed / 3× 429**, and
  **`127.0.0.2` × 3 → all allowed** — 127.0.0.0/8 is all loopback, so that is a genuinely
  different peer address with its own bucket, which is what proves the limit is **per-IP**
  and not global. `/api/health` unaffected; `.1` still 429 after.
- **Deliberate, documented trade:** an unknown peer (ip==0 — sandhi's contract on AGNOS, no
  BSD `getpeername`) is **not** limited. It fails open, because keying every unknown peer to
  one bucket would let one client lock out all others; unknown peers still face the
  concurrency cap. **Still open:** no per-*subject* lockout/backoff (bucket is keyed by
  address only). Suite: **9 unit + 48 backend + 13 full-stack UI**, green.
- **Test-harness honesty:** the suite drives ~50 logins from one source and would
  rate-limit *itself* at the production default, so `start_server()` sets a permissive burst
  and scenario 21 restarts with a tiny one to prove the limiter actually limits. The fix was
  a configurable limit, not a weak default.

### Added — credentials are Argon2id-hashed (the last plaintext gap, closed end-to-end)
- **`_auth_pw_ok` now verifies with Argon2id** (sigil 3.12.0 via cyrius **6.4.63**) at
  sy-core's exact parameters — m=19456 KiB, t=2, p=1, 32-byte tag, 16-byte salt — and
  constant-time compares the tag. **The demo passwords are no longer in the source**:
  `src/auth.cyr` stores only a salt + Argon2id tag per credential. This closes the probe's
  last plaintext-credential gap, and the primitive exists *because this probe filed it*:
  sigil had no password KDF, and the only route to Argon2id was escaping to OpenSSL's
  libcrypto through a soft-deprecated `tls_dlsym` hatch — rejected as non-sovereign.
  **Full arc: filed → implemented in sigil 3.12.0 → folded into cyrius 6.4.63 → adopted
  here**, in one cycle.
- **Concurrency:** logins run on sandhi workers, and sigil's allocating `argon2id` wrapper
  would call the non-thread-safe `fl_alloc` per login. So each worker allocates its ~19 MiB
  arena once (thread-local slot 13; sigil owns 8, patra 0-4, probe 14/15) and reuses it via
  **`argon2id_into`**, which touches no allocator.
- **Cost, measured:** ~**244 ms** and ~**19 MiB** per login on this host (sigil's scalar
  Cyrius vs ~30 ms for OpenSSL's AVX2 C — ~8×, and inside RFC 9106's interactive budget).
  Suite wall-clock 14s.
- **A DoS this opened — and closed in the same cycle.** Making passwords expensive to
  crack made `/api/login` cheap to abuse. **Correcting my own first claim:** I recorded it
  as "memory-amplifying, ~19 MiB per attempt"; measurement says otherwise — the per-worker
  arena keeps RSS flat at ~80 MB across 5 or 80 logins. The real vector is **worker
  saturation**: ~244 ms of a 4-worker pool per cheap request. Measured `GET /api/health`
  **6 ms → 942 ms** at 8 concurrent attempts; ~40 **wedged the server**. Fixed with
  admission control — at most **2** concurrent derivations, excess shed **429 before any
  Argon2 work**. Re-measured: 40 concurrent → `{429: 38, 401: 2}` in 0.5 s, `/api/health`
  **1 ms** during the burst, legit login still 200. New **scenario 20** guards it.
- **Still open (next auth bite):** a concurrency cap is not a rate limiter — 2 workers can
  be kept busy indefinitely. A per-IP token bucket + failure backoff needs the client
  address, which sandhi does not currently expose to the handler (possible sandhi ask).
- **Tests:** 9th unit invariant — the right password verifies; wrong / empty /
  off-by-one-byte are rejected; and the right password under the **wrong salt** is
  rejected (proving the salt is bound into the tag). Suite: **9 unit + 47 backend + 13
  full-stack UI**, green.

### Changed — cyrius pin 6.4.62 → 6.4.63; `lib/` re-synced to sigil 3.12.0
- 6.4.63 folds **sigil 3.12.0** (native BLAKE2b + Argon2id) and ships the fix for the
  shadow-`lib/` finding this probe filed: the note is now a **warning** that **names the
  skew** (`sigil 3.11.1 (pinned: 3.12.0), mabda 4.0.2 (pinned: 4.0.5)`) and prints the
  re-sync command. It caught a second stale bundle (**mabda** 4.0.2 → 4.0.5) immediately.

### Fixed — stale `lib/` was hiding sigil's slot-0 fix (a latent sigil⇄patra collision)
- **The probe was building against sigil 3.9.8, not the 3.11.1 the pinned cyrius 6.4.62
  folds.** `lib/` (gitignored, locally resolved) had drifted and *shadowed* the
  version-matched snapshot. The consequence was not cosmetic: 3.9.8 predates sigil
  **3.9.9's `_SIGIL_CBANK_SLOT` 0→8 fix**, so sigil's crypto-bank slot and patra's
  SQL-parse scratch (`enum SqlTls { TLS_TOKS = 0; … }`) were both pinned to thread-local
  **slot 0** — exactly the corruption condition sigil 3.9.9 fixed, in exactly the
  configuration its issue names (a TLS pool over a patra-backed API — *this probe*).
  **Latent, not observed** (the suite passed throughout; sigil reports the failure as
  layout-dependent), so this is an exposure, not a reproduced fault. Fixed with
  `cyrius lib sync --full` → sigil **3.11.1**, slot 8, clear of patra's 0-4. Suite
  re-verified green: **8 unit + 47 backend + 13 UI**. **Filed to cyrius**
  (`docs/development/issues/yeo-cy-test-shadow-lib-silent-version-skew.md`): the
  shadow-`lib/` note should name the actual skew (and warn, not note, when a bundled lib
  version differs) instead of staying silent about it.

### Changed — docs corrected
- **Retracted the overstated Argon2 finding.** "The ecosystem has no Argon2 … so the
  probe does a plaintext compare" was too strong: Argon2id *was* reachable via OpenSSL's
  `EVP_KDF` through cyrius's `tls_dlsym` hatch (verified). The accurate gap — **sigil
  shipped no NATIVE Argon2id, and the only path was a libcrypto ABI binding through a
  soft-deprecated hatch**, breaking sigil's "zero external crypto dependencies" — was
  fixed at the source: **sigil 3.12.0** now ships BLAKE2b (RFC 7693) + Argon2id/i/d
  (RFC 9106), driven by this probe. Probe adoption waits on a cyrius fold of 3.12.0.
- Current-state sigil version references corrected 3.9.9 → **3.11.1** (the docs had
  claimed the folded version while `lib/` actually carried 3.9.8).

### Added — RBAC enforcement on note mutations (auth applied to the real resource)
- **Note WRITES are now access-controlled; reads stay public.** The `auth` module's
  JWT/RBAC (previously demonstrated only on `/api/me` + `/api/admin`) is applied to the
  live `/api/notes` resource: `POST`/`PUT` require an authenticated session (any role),
  `DELETE` requires **role=admin**; `GET` list/detail stay public. The 401
  (unauthenticated) vs 403 (authenticated-but-unauthorized) split is now enforced on an
  actual mutation, not just a demo route — the full-stack "secured writes" guarantee.
- **Backend** (`src/main.cyr` + `src/auth.cyr`): a small request guard —
  `auth_req_claims` / `auth_req_role` — verifies the request's Bearer token, and the
  three mutation handlers gate on it before any DB work (401 on no/invalid token, 403
  on a non-admin DELETE). Mirrors the already-tested `handle_admin` verify → `_role_is`
  path exactly.
- **Frontend** (`web/app.tsx`): a real sign-in flow — `#/login` POSTs to `/api/login`,
  holds the HS256 JWT in memory, resolves the role via the Bearer-gated `/api/me`, and
  attaches `Authorization: Bearer` to every mutating fetch. The UI is **RBAC-aware**:
  the add form appears only when signed in, and the delete control only for admins — but
  the backend stays the authority (it enforces 401/403 regardless of what the UI shows).
  `#/logout` clears the session.
- **Tests**: `verify.py` +2 — scenario **0** (admin-login bootstrap: `req`/`https_req`
  auto-attach the admin Bearer token so every existing mutating scenario authenticates
  transparently; `token=None` opts out) and scenario **19** (the full write matrix:
  public read 200; unauth create/update/delete → 401; user create/update → 201/200;
  user DELETE → 403; admin DELETE → 200). `ui_check.mjs` reworked to drive the login
  form and assert the RBAC-aware UI (gated add pre-login; admin CRUD; user can add but
  the admin-only delete is hidden). Suite: **8 unit + 47 backend + 13 full-stack UI**,
  green.
- **No new lib gap** — this bite used only existing auth primitives (sigil HMAC, bayan
  base64url + the in-probe base64url decoder), so it surfaced nothing new to file: a
  positive signal that the ported `auth` stack was already sufficient for real RBAC.
  Standing gaps unchanged (no Cyrius Argon2 for password hashing; bote JWT is verify-only).

### Added — fifth `sy-core` module: `tee` (AES-256-GCM key sealing at rest)
- **`src/tee.cyr` — SecureYeoman's `tee` module.** sy-core's tee seals secrets with
  AES-256-GCM under a hardware-backed key; this ports the sealing onto **sigil**
  (AES-256-GCM + HKDF) and applies it to the persisted key material — so `yeo-auth.key`
  / `yeo-identity.key` are now **ciphertext at rest** (a 60-byte `[12 IV | 32 key | 16
  tag]` blob), not raw keys. `tee_seal`/`tee_unseal` (a plain AES-256-GCM
  seal/decrypt-verify); KEK = HKDF from `SY_SEAL_KEY` (a fixed insecure **dev key**
  fallback + warning if unset/empty). New **`GET /api/tee`** reports `{algorithm,
  sealed, key_source, dev_key}`. Verified: round-trip + ciphertext/tag tamper rejected
  (unit invariant 8), on-disk file is sealed 60 B (scenario 18), keys survive restart
  through sealing (scenario 17).
- **🟡 Finding — sigil's return conventions are inconsistent** (a consumer footgun):
  `aes_gcm_decrypt` returns **`SIGIL_ERR_NONE == 0` on success** (non-zero = tag
  mismatch), whereas `ed25519_verify` returns **`1` on success**. **Correction:** I
  briefly mis-recorded this as a "🔴 sigil aes_gcm_decrypt is broken" finding (I read
  `rc=0` as "rejected" when it means success) and built an unnecessary re-encrypt-verify
  workaround around my own inverted check. An **adversarial review + re-measurement
  caught it** — there is **no sigil bug**; the workaround was removed and `tee_unseal`
  now just checks `!= 0`. The real, filable finding is the API inconsistency. (To file —
  sigil DX; not a defect.)
- **Gap:** no hardware-backed KEK (no Cyrius TEE/TPM API) — the KEK is `SY_SEAL_KEY`-
  derived. Suite: **8 unit + 44 backend + 10 UI**, green. No dep bump (sigil/bayan
  already linked); `main.cyr` wires `tee_init` before `crypto_init`.

### Added — persistent keys at rest: JWTs + server identity survive a restart (crypto + auth)
- **The auth HS256 secret and the crypto Ed25519 identity are now persisted at rest**,
  closing the "ephemeral key" limitation both modules carried. `crypto_init` loads a
  32-byte Ed25519 **seed** from `yeo-identity.key` (re-deriving the keypair via
  `ed25519_keypair`), and `auth_init` loads the HMAC secret from `yeo-auth.key`; each
  generates + persists on first run. So a restart keeps issued JWTs valid and the
  server's published pubkey (and signed audit head) stable.
- **Owner-only (0600) at rest.** New shared `crypto_key_load`/`crypto_key_save`
  (`src/crypto.cyr`) use `file_open(…, O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC, 0600)` so key material
  is never world-readable. Both `*.key` files are gitignored.
- **Verified across a real restart.** New backend **scenario 17**: capture a token +
  pubkey, restart the server, and confirm the pre-restart token still verifies
  (`/api/me` 200) and the pubkey is unchanged — the keys were reloaded, not
  regenerated. New unit invariant (7th): a `crypto_key_save`→`crypto_key_load`
  round-trip, and a missing file loads as absent.
- **Honest limitation:** keys are **plaintext** files (0600). At-rest **sealing**
  (sy-core's `tee`, hardware-backed) is the remaining hardening — the plaintext files
  are the interim. Suite: **7 unit + 43 backend + 10 UI**, green.

### Added — fourth `sy-core` module ported: `auth` → JWT sessions + RBAC (login, Bearer-protected + role-gated routes)
- **`src/auth.cyr` — SecureYeoman's `auth` module, first bite (JWT sessions).** The
  token core of sy-core's auth (which is JWT + API keys + RBAC + OIDC/PKCE + WebAuthn).
  **`POST /api/login`** checks the admin credential and **issues a signed HS256 JWT**;
  **`GET /api/me`** is **Bearer-protected** (recompute + constant-time compare the
  signature, decode payload, enforce `exp`, return the subject, else 401). HS256 =
  HMAC-SHA256 via **sigil** (building on the crypto module) + base64url/JSON via bayan.
  Stateless (read-only secret) → thread-safe, no lock.
- **Independently verified.** New backend **scenario 15**: login → token → `/api/me`
  200 with `sub`; wrong password / no token / tampered token → 401; and the issued
  token decodes as a **standard RFC 7519 JWT** (alg/typ + sub/role/iat/exp) in Python —
  interop, not self-consistency. New unit invariant (6th): an issue→verify round-trip
  returns the subject + role, and a tampered + an expired token are both rejected.
- **RBAC.** JWTs carry a `role` claim (two demo credentials → `admin` / `user`), and
  **`GET /api/admin`** is **role-gated** (`role=admin`) — cleanly separating **401**
  (no/invalid token) from **403** (valid token, wrong role): the authentication vs
  authorization split. `GET /api/me` now returns `{sub, role}`. New backend
  **scenario 16** (admin→200, user→403, none→401).
- **Findings filed / flagged:**
  - 🔵 **bote (the mapping's JWT target) is verify-only.** Its `src/jwt.cyr` has
    `jwt_verify_hs256` but **no issue path** (it's an MCP *resource server*, not an
    IdP), and no thin `jwt`-only profile (you'd pull the ~93 KB MCP core for one fn).
    So issuance is built from primitives here. Recommend a `bote-jwt` profile with
    issue + verify. (Filed to bote.)
  - 🔵 **No Cyrius Argon2** (sy-core hashes the admin password with Argon2id) — the
    probe does a length-checked plaintext compare for now; a real deploy needs a
    password-hash primitive. (Gap noted.)
  - 🟡 **bayan `base64url_decode` returned null on a valid no-pad round-trip in-probe**
    (its own `base64url_encode` output). The dist impl reads correct; root cause
    unconfirmed. Worked around with an in-probe `_b64u_decode`. Flagged for upstream
    confirmation (not filed pending root-cause).
- **Limitations (future bites):** ephemeral HMAC secret (tokens don't survive a
  restart), plaintext credential, and PKCE / OIDC / WebAuthn (+ enforcing RBAC on the
  note mutations) still to come. Suite: **6 unit + 42 backend + 10 UI**, green.

### Added — third `sy-core` module ported: `crypto` → sigil (first server-side sigil use beyond TLS)
- **`src/crypto.cyr` — SecureYeoman's `crypto` module, ported onto sigil.** sy-core's
  crypto is the primitive layer (AES-GCM/X25519/Ed25519/SHA-2/HMAC/HKDF) that
  audit/auth/tee lean on; sigil is its Cyrius target (already linked for TLS — this is
  the first **server-side** use beyond the handshake). `crypto_init()` generates a
  server **Ed25519 identity keypair** (`ed25519_generate_keypair`), read-only after
  init so signing is thread-safe.
- **`GET /api/pubkey`** publishes the server's Ed25519 public key (`{alg, pubkey}`),
  and **`GET /api/audit` now includes `head_sig`** — an Ed25519 signature over the
  audit chain's head hash (signed under `g_audit_lock`). So a client gets **server
  authenticity** on top of libro's tamper-evidence: the audit log is provably from
  this server.
- **Independently verified.** New backend **scenario 14** verifies `head_sig` against
  `/api/pubkey` using Python's `cryptography` (OpenSSL Ed25519) — proving sigil's
  server-side signature interoperates with a standard implementation, not just itself
  (falls back to a structural check if `cryptography` is absent). New unit invariant
  (5th): a sign→verify round-trip (tamper rejected) + a **SHA-256 known-answer** (RFC
  6234 `"abc"` vector) for impl-independent correctness.
- **Gotcha fixed in-probe:** sigil's `hex_encode` returns a **cstr**, not a Cyrius
  `str`, so `crypto_pubkey_hex`/`crypto_sign_hex` wrap it in `str_from` before
  `json_v_str_new` (passing the raw cstr crashed the response handler).
- **Limitation (future bite):** the identity key is **ephemeral** — regenerated each
  process start, so the pubkey changes on restart. A persistent sealed key (à la
  sy-core's `tee`) is the natural follow-on. Suite: **5 unit + 40 backend + 10 UI**,
  green.

### Changed — audit chain is now DURABLE (libro patrastore); adopted patra 1.12.10 + libro 2.8.1 (the quote-corruption fixes this probe drove)
- **Bumped `[deps.patra]` 1.12.9 → 1.12.10 and `[deps.libro]` 2.8.0 → 2.8.1.** Both
  ship the fix for the single-quote corruption this probe hit for the third time:
  a `'` in a value written through libro's raw-SQL `patrastore_append` produced
  `PATRA_ERR_SYNTAX` and **silently dropped the record**. Fixed at both layers —
  **patra 1.12.10** (SQL tokenizer now implements standard `''` escaping +
  `patra_quote_str`) and **libro 2.8.1** (`patrastore_append` rewritten to a bound
  INSERT via `patra_prepare` + `patra_bind_text`). So the audit chain can now store
  arbitrary note content (quotes, injection payloads, unicode) verbatim.
- **`audit` module migrated in-memory → PERSISTENT (libro patrastore).**
  `src/audit.cyr` now appends each hash-linked entry to a patra-backed store
  (`yeo-audit.patra`, separate from the notes DB) instead of a process-global
  in-memory chain, so **the audit log survives a restart**. `GET /api/audit` gains
  a `persistent: true` field and re-verifies the **on-disk** chain each call.
  - **Connection-per-thread**, mirroring the notes DB: each worker opens its own
    patra handle to the audit file, lazily cached in thread-local **slot 14** (per
    `lib/thread_local.cyr`'s registry: 0-4 patra, 8 sigil, 15 notes, **14 audit**).
    patra is connection-per-thread — a handle opened on the main thread crashes when
    used by a worker (isolated + confirmed: single-threaded works, cross-thread
    doesn't), so audit uses per-thread handles like `db()`.
  - **`g_audit_lock` retained** (a hash chain is inherently serial — one writer at a
    time is correct, not a workaround) and now also holds the shared head hash
    (`g_audit_head`) consistent across workers.
  - **Head reconstruction on restart:** `audit_init` reloads the on-disk entries and
    sets the head to the last entry's hash, so appends after a restart link onto the
    existing chain and the whole chain still verifies across the boundary.
- **Tests:** backend **scenario 12** now asserts `persistent: true`; new **scenario
  12c** proves durability — the chain survives a full server restart with entries +
  head intact and still verified. `tests/verify.py` cleans `yeo-audit.patra`; suite
  is **4 unit + 39 backend + 10 UI**, green.

### Added — second `sy-core` module ported: `hwprobe` → ai-hwaccel
- **`src/hwprobe.cyr` — SecureYeoman's `hwprobe` module, ported onto ai-hwaccel
  (v2.3.14).** sy-core's hwprobe is "a thin wrapper around `ai_hwaccel`" (hardware-
  accelerator detection); ai-hwaccel is *already* a Cyrius lib, so the port is thin.
  `hwprobe_init()` runs **`registry_detect_no_exec()` once at startup** — detection
  via /sys + /proc only, **never spawning subprocesses** (no per-request fork/exec,
  no command-injection surface) — and caches `registry_to_summary_json(r)`. New
  **`GET /api/hwinfo`** serves the cached JSON `{device_count, has_accelerator,
  total_memory_bytes, accelerator_memory_bytes, gpu_count, tpu_count, npu_count,
  warnings}`. The cached string is immutable → all workers serve it lock-free.
- **Tests:** 4th unit invariant (detect→serialize yields non-empty JSON) + backend
  **scenario 13** (`/api/hwinfo` → 200, valid JSON, expected keys/types;
  hardware-agnostic so it passes on accelerator-less CI). Suite: **4 unit + 38
  backend + 10 UI**, green.
- **Deps:** `[deps.ai-hwaccel]` (2.3.14); added `args` to `[deps].stdlib` (ai-hwaccel's
  CLI helpers reference `argc`/`argv`, unused on the no-exec path). ai-hwaccel
  integrated cleanly — no upstream findings. Also **bumped libro 2.7.10 → 2.8.0**
  (now tagged; resolves the earlier "2.8.0 untagged" note).

### Added — first `sy-core` module ported: `audit` → libro (the probe starts growing into the real port)
- **`src/audit.cyr` — SecureYeoman's `audit` module, ported onto libro (v2.7.10).**
  The probe pivots from a pure viability slice toward the actual SecureYeoman → Cyrius
  port; `audit` is the first module in. sy-core's audit is an append-only, hash-linked
  cryptographic log; libro is a purpose-built SHA-256 hash-linked, tamper-evident audit
  chain — a near-exact lib match. Every note mutation (`create`/`update`/`delete`)
  appends a `SEV_INFO` entry to a process-global chain; **`GET /api/audit`** returns
  `{entries, verified, head}`, where `verified` is the live `chain_verify` result.
- **Appends serialize under `g_audit_lock`.** A hash-linked chain is inherently serial
  (each entry links the previous head's hash), so one writer at a time is *correct*, not
  a workaround — unlike the db layer, which went lock-free via per-thread handles.
- **Verified under the probe's full concurrency.** New backend **scenario 12**: after
  all prior scenarios (incl. 250 + 60 *concurrent* mutations → 641 entries) the chain
  still `verified` (a torn concurrent append would break the links and flip it false),
  and a controlled create+update+delete adds exactly 3 linked entries with an advancing
  head. New unit invariant (3rd): `chain_append` → `chain_verify` OK, head advances.
- **Deps:** `[deps.libro]` (2.7.10 — latest published tag; local `VERSION` is 2.8.0 but
  untagged). GPL-3.0-only, compatible with this project's AGPL-3.0-only. libro's stdlib
  requires (`fs`, `process`, `ct`, `keccak`, `thread_local`, `slice`) added to
  `[deps].stdlib` per its `dist/libro.deps` sidecar. libro integrated cleanly — no
  upstream findings.
- **Limitation (next bite):** the chain is in-memory, so it resets on restart. libro's
  `patrastore_*` (patra-backed persistence) is the planned follow-on. Suite: **3 unit +
  37 backend + 10 UI**, green.

### Changed — toolchain 6.4.62: last lock removed (lock-free reads), thin sandhi profile bundle adopted
- **Bumped to cyrius 6.4.62 / patra 1.12.9 / sandhi 1.8.2 (thin `server` profile
  bundle) / sigil 3.9.9 (via cyrius) / sakshi 2.4.6.** Baseline re-verified green on
  the new pins: build OK, 2 unit invariants, **35 backend** + 10 UI scenarios pass.
- ✅ **Removed `g_db_lock` — the probe is now fully lock-free.** patra **1.12.8**'s
  `_rs_materialize` snapshots every TEXT/BYTES payload into an owned heap buffer
  *while the query's shared flock is held*, so `patra_result_read_text` is a pure
  memcpy — closing the readback race that was the lock's last remaining job (see the
  6.3.42 entry). Folded into patra **1.12.9** and adopted here: handlers call `db()`
  (this worker's own per-thread handle) directly, no mutex. patra's
  connection-per-thread "lock-free parallel reads" promise is delivered for TEXT
  columns too (was fixed-width only). New **scenario 11** (`tests/verify.py`) proves
  it: 310 reads during concurrent writes → **0 torn/garbled**.
- ✅ **Adopted sandhi's thin `server` profile bundle (sandhi 1.8.0 → 1.8.2).** sandhi
  is pulled via `[deps.sandhi]` as `dist/sandhi-server.cyr` (**141 KB vs the 590 KB
  full folded bundle, ~76 % smaller**) instead of the folded-stdlib monolith — the
  **"bundled-libs → individual-packages split" this probe filed**, now shipped and
  **dogfooded here as sandhi's first profile-bundle consumer**. The thin bundle
  carries only session_cache + conn + server/mod, so `bayan` (`json_v_*`) and
  `hashmap` (`map_*`, sandhi's TLS session cache) — previously transitive — are now
  **declared explicitly** in `[deps].stdlib`. sandhi 1.8.1 made `run_pooled_tls` safe
  at `max_conns>1`; the TLS pool stays at 4 (verified: scenarios 9/10/11 green).

### Changed — toolchain 6.3.42: both residuals shipped (both were consumer misdiagnoses); new patra finding
- **Bumped to cyrius 6.3.42 / patra 1.12.7 / sandhi 1.7.0 / sigil 3.9.9 (folded) /
  sakshi 2.4.3.** (Asked for 6.3.41; cycc auto-drifted 6.3.41→6.3.42 same day — pin
  matched to the installed cycc. 6.3.42 is a probe-irrelevant, cycc-byte-identical
  protobuf-only release; the residual fixes landed in 6.3.24 and 6.3.25.)
- ✅ **Removed the `db_path()` fn workaround.** The "string-literal-global-at-scale"
  crash was a **misdiagnosis** — `var DB_PATH` collided by name with patra's exported
  `enum DbOff { DB_PATH = 16 }`; cyrius resolved the symbol to the last registration,
  so `patra_open`'s `store64(db + DB_PATH, …)` used a string pointer as an ABI offset
  → SIGSEGV. cyrius 6.3.24 made a non-int-literal var shadowing an enum a **hard
  error**. Fix: the path is now a plain global renamed to dodge the collision,
  `var g_dbpath = "yeo.patra"`. Verified: `var DB_PATH = …` now errors cleanly;
  `g_dbpath` builds and the full suite is green.
- ✅ **Bumped the TLS pool `max_conns` 1 → 4.** The multi-worker `RECORD_LAYER_FAILURE`
  was a **thread-local slot-0 collision** between sigil's crypto banks and patra's
  parse scratch (both hardcoded slot 0) — deterministic (every 4th handshake), not
  the "mixed pattern" filed. Fixed in sigil 3.9.9 (slot 0→8) + a slot-namespace
  registry (cyrius 6.3.25). Verified on 6.3.42: verify.py **5/5 clean at max_conns=4**,
  amplified mixed-pattern stress **0 errors** at 4 and 8 (no bank exhaustion).
- 🔴 **NEW finding (patra) + `g_db_lock` correction.** patra's TEXT/BLOB readback
  (`patra_result_read_text`) reads pages **after** `patra_query` drops its shared
  flock, so a concurrent writer can tear the body. **`g_db_lock` is REQUIRED and is
  kept** to hold each SELECT + `note_row_json` readback atomic — **correcting the
  6.3.12 entry below that claimed it was removed** (it was removed for the
  now-fixed table-cache race, but is required for this readback race). Filed to patra.
- 🔵 **Filed the `mutex_*` duplicate-definition warning** (`thread.cyr` ⇄ `sync.cyr`,
  benign, 3 warnings/build) to cyrius, referencing the archived `arena_*` precedent.

### Changed — toolchain 6.3.23: str_builder gate SHIPPED, multi-worker TLS unblocked
- **Bumped to cyrius 6.3.23 / patra 1.12.7 / sandhi 1.7.0 / sigil 3.9.7 (folded) /
  sakshi 2.4.3.** (Asked for 6.3.22; cycc auto-drifted to 6.3.23 same day — pin
  matched to the installed cycc.)
- ✅ **str_builder concurrency FIXED (cyrius 6.3.15)** — root cause was array-local
  codegen (now per-thread by default). Verified: minimal repro 0 (was ~87%),
  `concurrency_repro.sh` 0/300, and the concurrency scenarios (verify.py 4/8/10) are
  now **stable** (were flaky). Multi-worker TLS **fundamentally works**: `max_conns=4`
  serves 100/100 concurrent HTTPS cleanly (no crash, no BAD_SIGNATURE).
- **Kept the `db_path()` fn workaround** — cyrius's string-literal-global fix (6.3.16)
  works in small programs but still holds garbage in this large one (sandhi+sigil's
  ~14 MB `.bss`), SIGSEGV'ing `patra_open` at startup. Filed a cyrius follow-up.
- **TLS pool stays at `max_conns=1`** — a residual `RECORD_LAYER_FAILURE` at >1 worker
  under verify.py's mixed pattern (not reproducible under pure concurrent load) blocks
  the bump to 4. Filed cyrius-side. (Everything else on the multi-worker path is green.)

### Changed — toolchain 6.3.12 + adopted the upstream fixes
- **Bumped to cyrius 6.3.12 / patra 1.12.7 / sandhi 1.7.0 / sigil 3.9.7 (folded) /
  sakshi 2.4.2** (pin matched to the installed cycc to avoid lib/compiler skew).
- **Removed `g_db_lock`** — patra 1.12.7 moved its table-lookup cache
  (`_tbl_lp_idx`/`_page`) from a process-global into the db handle, fixing the
  probe-filed connection-per-thread read race. Concurrent reads are now lock-free
  and correctness-safe (stress: 0/300 corrupt, was ~90%+). Handlers call `db()`
  directly; per-handle last_insert_id/rows_affected need no lock.

### Resolution of filed findings (verified on 6.3.12)
- ✅ patra table-cache race (1.12.7) · ✅ sandhi h2 IPv6 arity (1.7.0) · ✅ sandhi
  misleading pooled-TLS comment (1.7.0) — all shipped + adopted.
- ✅ sigil concurrent-TLS **crash FIXED (3.9.7)** — `cbank()` auto-assigns a per-thread
  lane (64 banks); no sandhi/sigil change needed (cyrius 6.3.12 bundles it). Verified
  max_conns=4 no longer SIGSEGVs + sigil's own concurrent-TLS tests pass 18/18. My
  earlier "sandhi per-worker bank" finding was off a **stale `lib/sigil.cyr` (3.9.4)**
  and is withdrawn — **`cyrius lib sync --full`** is required (bare sync doesn't
  refresh transitive deps like sigil). TLS pool still pinned to 1 worker, but for the
  **str_builder** bug now (concurrent response buffers overlap → corrupt mid-TLS-encrypt
  → `SSL: BAD_SIGNATURE`), not sigil.
- 🔴 cyrius `str_builder` thread-safety + 🟡 string-literal global initializer —
  still open (held gate slots); the probe keeps `db_path()`. 🔵: a `sync.cyr`/`thread.cyr`
  `mutex_*` duplicate-definition build warning (benign); sigil 3.9.7's 64 banks add
  ~14 MB lazy-zero `.bss`.

### Changed (deep-dive: connection-per-thread + a cyrius-core concurrency blocker)
- **patra persistence moved to connection-per-thread.** Each sandhi worker opens
  its own patra handle, lazily cached in a thread-local slot (`db()`, TLS slot 15;
  patra owns 0–4) — patra 1.12.0's intended parallel-read model. `last_insert_id`
  / `rows_affected` are now per-handle (no cross-worker readback race), so the old
  `g_wr_lock` is gone. **But** every patra op is serialized under a single
  `g_db_lock` as a workaround: patra's table-lookup cache (`_tbl_lp_idx` /
  `_tbl_lp_page`, `src/table.cyr:4-5`) is still process-global, so concurrent
  readers on separate handles race it → garbled rows (filed patra-side; drop the
  lock when patra makes that cache per-handle).
- **DB path via a fn, not a `var = "literal"` global** (`db_path()`) — a top-level
  string-literal global compiles clean but holds garbage at runtime in cyrius
  (integer-only global initializers) and SIGSEGV'd at startup. Filed cyrius-side.

### Findings filed upstream (the real deliverable of this pass)
- **🔴 cyrius `str_builder` is not thread-safe** — concurrent HTTP responses
  corrupt ~3% under load (curl `/api/health`, byte-interleaved across fields). An
  8-thread bisect pinned it to the `str_builder` library functions (`lib/str.cyr`)
  — bare `alloc()`, `alloc_via(default_alloc())`, `memcpy`, and a byte-identical
  hand-rolled replica are all 100% clean; str_builder corrupts ~87% (≥2 threads,
  0% single-threaded). The foundational blocker — every concurrent string build
  (sandhi responses, `json_v_build`) corrupts. New `tests/concurrency_repro.sh`
  reproduces it (diagnostic, exits 0). Filed cyrius
  `issues/2026-06-28-str-builder-not-thread-safe.md`.
- **🔴 patra parallel-read table-cache race** + **🟡 cyrius string-literal global
  initializer crash** (both above) — filed patra/cyrius-side.
- **sigil** concurrent-TLS-handshake issue **broadened** (HKDF-primary,
  per-thread banks never activated for TLS, `ed25519_sign` unbanked, both ciphers
  crash; AES-GCM-bulk claim refuted) and **sandhi** misleading pooled-TLS
  safety-comment filed.

### Removed
- The hard concurrent-read assertion (former scenario 11) — it exposes the
  upstream cyrius `str_builder` corruption, not a probe bug, so it is not a
  pass/fail gate. `tests/concurrency_repro.sh` documents it instead. The remaining
  concurrency scenarios (4/8/10) can flake on the same upstream bug.

### Changed
- **Toolchain bump to cyrius 6.3.0 / patra 1.12.6 / sandhi 1.6.13 (folded) /
  sakshi 2.4.0** (was 6.2.21 / 1.11.4 / 1.6.7 / 2.3.1). Baseline re-verified
  green on the new pins before any code change (44 checks unchanged).
- **Adopted sandhi's server-side TLS + Conn-aware router — retired the
  hand-rolled HTTPS stack.** Both of the probe's headline TLS findings shipped
  upstream and are now adopted: **sandhi server-side TLS** (`sandhi_server_run_pooled_tls`
  + the `_c`/`_cp` conn-aware router family, sandhi 1.6.10) and **`tls_native`
  server-side ALPN** (cyrius 6.2.22). So `src/httpd.cyr` dropped its `Conn`
  transport seam, `tls_serve` / `tls_recv_request` accept loop, `_alpn_h1` wire,
  process-wide SIGPIPE guard, and probe-owned route table (~225 → ~95 lines) — it
  is now just JSON/file response helpers over `sandhi_server_send_response_c`.
  `src/main.cyr` registers routes on `sandhi_router_new` / `_add` and serves both
  transports off **one** handler set: plaintext :8080 via `sandhi_server_run_pooled`
  + `sandhi_server_router_handler_cp`, HTTPS :8443 via `sandhi_server_run_pooled_tls`
  + `sandhi_server_router_handler_c` (cert/key through `sandhi_server_options_tls`,
  same DER-leaf + PEM-key shapes). **ALPN now negotiates `http/1.1`** (was "No
  ALPN negotiated"). `_cstr_eq` moved to `src/test.cyr` (its only remaining user).

### Added
- `tests/verify.py` grew to **34 scenarios**: **9i** asserts server-side ALPN now
  selects `http/1.1` (the resolved finding), **10** drives 60 concurrent HTTPS
  POSTs (all succeed, server stays up) — a tripwire for the sigil concurrency bug
  below.

### Fixed / worked around
- **🔴 sigil crypto scratch is process-global → concurrent TLS handshakes crash
  the server.** Driving `sandhi_server_run_pooled_tls` with >1 worker, 2+
  simultaneous client handshakes race sigil's ~60 module-global scratch buffers
  (SHA-NI/AES-NI state, bignum modexp/Montgomery accumulators) → corrupted
  handshake (ECONNRESET) or memory corruption (**SIGSEGV**, server down). sandhi's
  own TLS gate never caught it (sequential bursts; its "isolation" pins a worker
  with a *plaintext* silent socket — never 2 concurrent handshakes). **Workaround:
  the probe's TLS pool is pinned to 1 worker** (serialized handshakes — crash-safe,
  as the old single-threaded `tls_serve` was); plaintext HTTP stays at 4 workers
  (no crypto). Filed upstream; restore the multi-worker TLS pool once sigil is
  thread-safe. See FINDINGS.
- **🟡 sandhi h2-promote IPv6 path calls `_sandhi_conn_open_v6_fully_timed_a` with
  8 args (needs 9).** Surfaced as a build warning against folded sandhi 1.6.13
  (`src/http/h2/dispatch.cyr:145` missed the trailing `ctx` from the 1.6.9 reqctx
  change that `client.cyr` got). Client-side / IPv6-h2 only — the probe doesn't hit
  it, but it's a latent wrong-arg on that path. Filed cyrius/sandhi-side.

### Added (full-stack milestone)
- **Full notes-dashboard frontend + headless full-stack proof.** `web/app.tsx`
  grew from a list+add shell into a real CRUD UI: a `#/notes/:id` detail/edit
  route (GET by id + PUT), per-row delete (DELETE), and live Home status — so the
  browser now exercises the *entire* `/api/notes` resource. New
  `tests/ui_check.mjs` loads the **real cyrius-emitted `web/app.js`** into a
  minimal DOM+fetch shim against a running server and drives the rendered UI
  (list → add → open detail → edit → delete), cross-checking the DOM against the
  patra backend at each step (10 scenarios incl. XSS-safe text-node rendering).
  **Proves the whole stack together**: app.tsx → `cyrius --target=js` → browser
  JS → fetch → sandhi router → patra → JSX render. New `tests/run.sh` runs
  build + unit + 32 backend + 10 UI in one command. The TS/TSX→JS emitter
  handled a real multi-view CRUD SPA cleanly (positive finding — see FINDINGS).
- **HTTPS listener on :8443** over `tls_native` + `sigil` (pure-Cyrius TLS 1.3,
  Ed25519 cert/key via `gen-certs.sh`), serving the same routes as HTTP :8080 —
  both run together (plaintext in a worker thread, TLS in main), sharing one
  handler set and the patra backend. New `src/httpd.cyr` pieces: a `Conn`
  transport seam (`conn_write` → `sock_send` | chunked `tls_native_write`),
  conn-based `resp_*` framing (replicated from sandhi — it has no frame-to-buffer
  helper), `tls_serve` / `tls_recv_request` (hand-rolled accept loop — sandhi has
  no server-side TLS hook), and a conn-aware `srv_dispatch` over sandhi's matcher.
  `gen-certs.sh` mints the Ed25519 cert (RSA is rejected by `tls_native`);
  `build.sh` auto-mints if absent; cert/key are gitignored. Verified: 32 scenarios
  (24 HTTP + 8 HTTPS) — TLS 1.3 handshake, cert verify (`Verify return code: 0`),
  CRUD over TLS, injection/unicode-safe, untrusted-cert rejection, shared backend.
  Findings filed (sandhi server-TLS gap; `tls_native` server-side ALPN missing;
  RSA-key + cert-tooling gaps). See FINDINGS.md.
- `tests/verify.py` gained scenario 9 (HTTPS): CRUD over TLS, real cert
  verification, HTTP↔HTTPS shared-backend check.

### Added (earlier)
- **Full single-note REST resource** — `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE /api/notes/:id`,
  alongside the existing list/create. Exercises patra's `SELECT…WHERE` /
  `UPDATE` / `DELETE` with bound `?` params (first non-INSERT bind use) and a
  new **`:name` path-param router** in `httpd.cyr` (`route_match`:
  segment-by-segment matching, `:name` capture, equal-segment-count rule;
  `req_param` / `req_param_int` accessors). Verified end to end (get-by-id,
  404/400 edges, injection-safe update, idempotent delete, 405 on unmapped
  method, restart persistence) + a `route_match` unit test in `src/test.cyr`.
  Surfaced findings: patra has no rows-affected/`last_insert_id` readback
  (worked around with a pre-SELECT for `PUT`); Cyrius allows forward fn refs
  within a file. See FINDINGS.md.
- **Concurrency: a fixed worker-thread pool** in `httpd.cyr` (`thread.cyr`
  `thread_create` + a bounded `chan_*` handoff), replacing the single-threaded
  accept loop — a slow client now ties up only its worker. `alloc()` is
  thread-safe, so JSON/string building across workers is safe. DB access needs
  no external lock: patra is internally thread-safe (v1.11.0+), and the app's
  own id counter is bumped with `atomic_fetch_add` (`&g_next_id`) — see the
  lock-removal note under _Changed_. Verified: `/api/health` ~10ms while silent
  connections hold 2/4 workers; 250 concurrent POSTs → 0 errors, 250 unique
  contiguous ids. Filed patra thread-safety **P1/P2** to patra's roadmap; P1
  shipped in patra 1.11.0. Added `thread`, `atomic` to the stdlib deps.
- **`httpd_recv_full`** — reads a complete request (headers, then
  `Content-Length` body) instead of a single `sock_recv`; fixes POST bodies that
  arrive in a later TCP segment (dropped → spurious 400 under non-curl clients).
- **`src/httpd.cyr` — an HTTP/1.1 server abstraction**, extracted from the
  hand-rolled socket loop (addresses the FINDINGS "no HTTP server abstraction"
  gap in-probe). Request parsing (method / path / query / headers / body), a
  function-pointer route table with method-aware dispatch (404 for unknown
  path, **405** for wrong method), response framing helpers (`resp_json` /
  `resp_file` / `resp_json_err` / …), and the accept loop `httpd_serve`.
  `main.cyr` now just registers routes; handlers share the signature
  `fn(cfd, req): i64`.
- **SecureYeoman dashboard shell** (`web/app.tsx`): header + nav with a hash
  router (`#/` Home — service status + note count; `#/notes` — list + add).
  `web/index.html` is now a minimal `#app` mount + dashboard CSS.

### Changed
- **Fixed the patra shared-handle readback race (confirmed under concurrency).**
  The scenario-8 probe caught a real spurious 404 (concurrent PUTs racing on
  `DB_ROWS_AFFECTED`). Added a narrow `g_wr_lock` pairing each `[exec_prepared;
  readback]` (create's `last_insert_id`, PUT/DELETE's `rows_affected`) atomically;
  reads stay lock-free. Now deterministic (8/8 runs). Upgrades the earlier
  "latent" finding to confirmed+fixed and strengthens the filed patra
  atomic-insert-returning-id request. See FINDINGS.md.
- **Routing now goes through a `Conn`-aware `srv_dispatch`** (reusing sandhi's
  `sandhi_server_route_match`) instead of `sandhi_server_router_handler`, because
  the latter is plaintext-welded (its handlers `sock_send`). Plaintext keeps
  `run_pooled` via a `_plain_handler` adapter; handlers now take a `Conn` instead
  of a raw fd. sandhi's matcher remains the adopted piece.
- **Re-run on cyrius 6.2.21 / patra 1.11.4 / sandhi 1.6.7 / sakshi 2.3.1** (was
  6.2.18 / 1.11.2 / 1.6.5 / 2.3.1; sandhi is folded into the cyrius toolchain, so
  the cyrius bump pulls 1.6.7). All previously-filed findings are now resolved
  upstream; 2 unit invariants + 24 end-to-end scenarios pass, nothing regressed.
- **Adopted patra's write-readback (1.11.3).** `PUT /api/notes/:id` drops its
  pre-`SELECT` existence check — it `UPDATE`s and 404s on
  `patra_rows_affected == 0` (one statement, not two); `DELETE` now 404s on a
  missing id (was idempotent-200, a workaround for the missing count).
- **Adopted patra `AUTOINCREMENT` + `last_insert_id` (1.11.3).** Schema is
  `id INT AUTOINCREMENT`; create uses a column-list `INSERT` and echoes
  `patra_last_insert_id`. Removed the app-side `g_next_id` + `MAX(id)` seeding +
  `atomic_fetch_add`. Caveats filed (FINDINGS): a shared-handle `last_insert_id`
  echo race (latent — did not reproduce at 24 workers × 2400 inserts) and
  AUTOINCREMENT id-reuse (derive-from-MAX; observed in the suite).
- **Adopted sandhi's server route table (1.6.7).** Replaced the hand-rolled
  `route_match`/router + `Req` struct with `sandhi_router_*` +
  `sandhi_server_router_handler`; handlers moved to sandhi's
  `fn(app_ctx, cfd, buf, blen, params)` signature. `src/test.cyr` now validates
  sandhi's matcher. 404/405 are now sandhi's (status-only, not JSON).
- **Adopted sandhi `sandhi_server_run_pooled` (1.6.7).** Replaced the
  hand-rolled accept loop + worker pool (and the `httpd_ignore_sigpipe` shim —
  run_pooled installs the SIGPIPE `SIG_IGN` guard itself, Linux) with
  `sandhi_server_run_pooled` (`max_conns = 4`; gains a `SO_RCVTIMEO` slowloris
  guard). `src/httpd.cyr` collapsed 353 → 83 lines (response/body glue only) —
  **the probe is now a thin sandhi + patra composition.** Both features
  (route table + thread pool) were filed by this probe and shipped in sandhi
  1.6.7.
- Added `tests/verify.py` — the 24-scenario end-to-end harness (CRUD lifecycle,
  injection/unicode round-trip + restart, 250-concurrent unique ids, slow-client
  isolation, smuggling rejects, SIGPIPE survival, rows_affected concurrency).
- **Ported the HTTP service layer onto `sandhi/server`.** `src/httpd.cyr` is now
  a thin shim that composes sandhi for all wire work — `sandhi_server_recv_request`
  / `get_method` / `get_path` / `path_only` / `find_header` / `body_offset` /
  `send_response` / `send_status`, plus the CL-TE and duplicate-header
  **request-smuggling rejects** the hand-rolled server lacked. Kept on top: the
  route table + `:name` matcher (sandhi has no server router yet) and the
  worker-thread pool (sandhi's `run`/`run_async` aren't truly parallel).
  `main.cyr` + patra storage unchanged (`resp_*`/`req_*` signatures preserved).
  Added `httpd_ignore_sigpipe()` (`rt_sigaction(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)`) — sandhi/net
  don't set `MSG_NOSIGNAL`, so a client disconnecting mid-response was crashing
  the server (signal 13). Deps: `+sandhi` and its transitive modules
  `tls`/`async`/`random`/`fdlopen`/`dynlib`; dropped `json` (use sandhi's bundled
  `bayan`). Re-verified: 13-case CRUD, 250 concurrent POSTs (250 unique ids),
  slow-client isolation (~10 ms), smuggling rejects (CL+TE / CL.CL → 400).
  Filed to sandhi's roadmap: the SIGPIPE bug (HIGH); a docs note (opt-in
  companion modules + "use bayan not json"); the server-only ~400 KB static
  surface as a data point for the long-term bundled-libs→packages split; and a
  request for a thread-pool serve mode (`sandhi_server_run_pooled`).
- Re-run on **cyrius 6.2.18 / patra 1.11.2 / sakshi 2.3.1** (was 6.1.15 /
  1.10.3 / 2.2.6). Both original 🔴 blockers stay closed; clean build, invariant
  test, injection/unicode round-trip, restart persistence, and the concurrency
  suite all re-verified end to end on the new toolchain.
- **Removed the `g_db_lock` workaround.** patra's thread-safety **P1 shipped in
  v1.11.0** (a process-global mutex serializes every statement op; result-set
  accessors are caller-owned) — the filed finding from this probe — so the
  app-level mutex around all patra calls is gone. The only thing patra doesn't
  cover is the app's id allocation, now done lock-free with
  `atomic_fetch_add(&g_next_id, 1)`. Re-verified: 250 concurrent POSTs still
  yield 250 unique contiguous ids with no lock.
- _(earlier re-run)_ cyrius 6.1.15 / patra 1.10.3 / sakshi 2.2.6 (was 6.0.3 /
  1.9.5 / 2.2.5). Both original 🔴 blockers were closed upstream and verified.
- **Frontend is now built by cyrius.** `web/app.js` is generated from
  `web/app.tsx` via `cyrius build --target=js` (TS/TSX→JS + JSX→`h` emitter,
  cyrius 6.1.11+); the hand-lowered stopgap is retired. `app.tsx` is now the
  whole app (render loop + mount), not just exported pieces. `build.sh` runs the
  real emit + `node --check`.
- **patra storage uses bound parameters.** Note bodies are stored in a `TEXT`
  column via `patra_prepare` + `patra_bind_text` + `patra_exec_prepared`
  (patra 1.10.3), replacing the base64-encode-for-SQL-safety stopgap. Removes
  the 256-byte body cap and is SQL-injection safe.
- `src/test.cyr` rewritten to assert the patra bound-text invariant (verbatim
  round-trip + injection safety) instead of the retired base64 invariant.
- Dropped `base64` from the stdlib dep list (no longer used).
- `lib/` is now untracked + gitignored; regenerated locally with `cyrius lib
  sync` + `cyrius deps` (was a 6.0.3-era vendored copy shadowing the pinned
  toolchain snapshot).

### Findings (filed)
- 🔴 **sandhi has no server-side TLS** — its serve loops/options/send paths are
  plaintext-only, so HTTPS required bypassing sandhi and hand-rolling a
  `tls_native` accept loop. Ask: a server TLS option (cert/key/ALPN) or a
  transport seam. (Filed to sandhi roadmap.)
- 🟡 **`tls_native` server-side ALPN not implemented** — `set_alpn` wires only the
  client offer; a server never negotiates ALPN (`openssl s_client` → "No ALPN
  negotiated"), so h2-over-TLS is unreachable server-side. (Filed cyrius-side.)
- 🔵 **`tls_native` rejects RSA server keys** (Ed25519/ECDSA only) + **no first-party
  cert/keygen/ACME tooling** — minted via openssl (`gen-certs.sh`).
- ✅ **Confirmed + fixed: patra shared-handle readback race** (see _Changed_) —
  strengthens the filed `requests/2026-06-18-…-insert-returning-id`.
- ✅ **All probe-filed ecosystem findings shipped upstream** (verified file:line):
  sandhi route table (1.6.7) + `sandhi_server_run_pooled` (1.6.7) + SIGPIPE guard
  (1.6.6) + docs (1.6.6); patra `last_insert_id`/`rows_affected` (1.11.3); cyrius
  async leak (6.1.22). All adopted (see _Changed_). Several credit yeo-cy-test.
- 🔵 **patra: shared-handle `last_insert_id`/`rows_affected` readback race.** The
  fields live on the shared handle and the write + readback are two non-atomic
  ops, so concurrent writers can read each other's value. Did not reproduce
  (24×2400), but filed: an atomic `INSERT … RETURNING id` / id-from-`exec_prepared`
  would make it race-free for concurrent inserts. Until then the race-free choice
  is app-assigned ids.
- 🔵 **sandhi: `run_pooled` handoff channel is sized to the worker count,** so a
  thundering-herd burst far exceeding workers sheds via the listen backlog (clean
  ECONNRESET, no data loss). A backlog depth decoupled from `max_conns` would
  absorb bursts better. (Filed as a note; size `max_conns` to workload meanwhile.)
- 🟡 **cyrius: `fmt <file> --check` continuation false-positive persists on
  6.2.21** — flags the two-line `sandhi_server_send_response` call in
  `src/httpd.cyr` (exit 1) while apply-mode `cyrius fmt` is byte-identical.
- ⚠️ **Correction: the HTTP server abstraction exists — it's `sandhi`.** The
  original "no HTTP server abstraction" verdict looked at top-level stdlib
  primitives; the real services lib is `sandhi` (`sandhi/server`, a lift of
  stdlib `lib/http_server.cyr`): serve loop (sync + async), full-request read,
  method/path/param accessors, response framing, **and request-smuggling
  defenses** the probe lacks. What sandhi doesn't have yet is a route table
  (roadmapped) — which is exactly what the probe's `route_match` provides. Next
  step: port `src/httpd.cyr` onto `sandhi_server_*`. See FINDINGS.md.
- ✅ `cyrius --target=js` misplaced `async` when an `async function` contains a
  nested arrow → invalid JS. Reported from this probe; **fixed in cyrius
  6.1.15** (`async` now binds to the function it was parsed on). The `.map`
  arrow workaround in `web/app.tsx` has been removed.
- ✅ Tracked `./lib/` shadowing the pinned toolchain — resolved by untracking +
  gitignoring `lib/` and regenerating via `cyrius lib sync`. See FINDINGS.md.
