## The Business Case for Sovereign AI

- **CISO** — Zero CVEs. Not because we're lucky — because we're paranoid.
- **COO** — No cloud dependency means no cloud surprises. Your schedule, your uptime.
- **CFO / Legal** — Every compliance framework needs controls. We ship them, not slide decks.
- **CTO** — One binary. 485 tools. Six fewer vendor contracts.
- **CEO / Board** — Your competitors are patching. You're shipping.
