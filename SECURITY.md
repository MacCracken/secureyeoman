## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Disclosure Process

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

#### Step 1: Report Privately

**Do NOT open a public issue!** Instead, report vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

- **Email**: security@friday.dev
- **GitHub Private Report**: [Submit private vulnerability report](https://github.com/MacCracken/secureyeoman/security/advisories/new)
- **PGP Key**: Available for encrypted communication on request

#### Step 2: Include in Your Report

Please include the following information:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact if exploited
- **Suggested Fix**: (optional) How you think it should be fixed

#### Step 3: Timeline

We aim to respond within:

- **48 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **7 days**: Assessment and patch development
- **14 days**: Security release (if confirmed)

### Public Disclosure

We will coordinate public disclosure with you:

- Fix will be developed and tested
- Security release will be prepared
- CVE ID will be requested (if applicable)
- Public disclosure will be coordinated with your timeline

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

SecureYeoman includes several security features:

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: JWT and API key authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail with cryptographic integrity
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environment
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage and rotation

### Security Architecture

For detailed information about our security architecture, see:

- [Security Model](docs/security/security-model.md)
- [Security Testing Guide](docs/guides/security-testing.md)
- [Architecture Overview](docs/development/architecture.md)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always run the latest version
2. **Strong Authentication**: Use strong, unique passwords
3. **Network Security**: Run behind firewalls when possible
4. **Regular Audits**: Review audit logs regularly
5. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use minimal required permissions

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Never trust user input
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and regularly audit them
4. **Testing**: Write security tests alongside functional tests
5. **Review**: Have security changes peer-reviewed

## Common Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Local-First**: Data stays on your system by default
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- **Audit Trail**: All access is logged and verifiable
- **Secret Management**: Secrets are never logged or exposed

### Network Security

- **TLS Only**: All network communications use TLS 1.3
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict certificate validation
- **Domain Whitelisting**: Only approved domains are accessed
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and attacks

### Application Security

- **Sandboxing**: Code execution in isolated environment
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and network constraints
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning

We regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scanning**: GitHub Actions security audit
- **Manual Reviews**: Regular manual security reviews
- **Patch Management**: Prompt patching of vulnerable dependencies
- **Advisories**: Security advisories for affected versions

### Security Testing

Our security testing includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning for security issues
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Fuzz Testing**: Input validation testing

### Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Contain and assess the impact
2. **Communication**: Notify affected users
3. **Remediation**: Patch and fix the vulnerability
4. **Post-Mortem**: Learn and improve processes
