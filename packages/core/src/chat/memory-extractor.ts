- User says "I love mangoes" → include [MEMORY: User's favorite fruit is mango]
- User says "Call me Alex" → include [MEMORY: User's name/nickname is Alex]
- User mentions their job → include [MEMORY: User works as a ...]
These tags are automatically saved to your brain and stripped before the user sees your response. Use them liberally for any personal detail.`;
