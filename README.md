## Mission Statement

To provide a decentralized, local-first intelligence that prioritizes user privacy without sacrificing the "always-on" utility of a modern digital assistant. **F.R.I.D.A.Y.** isn't just a tool; it's your personal digital Yeoman.

## About FRIDAY

**FRIDAY** is a personal assistant designed with a focus on being **safe and secure**. Much like its namesake, this system is built to be a loyal and tireless "Yeoman" -- a dependable guardian of your digital workflow and personal data.

### Why the "Yeoman" Designation?

In engineering and historical contexts, a **Yeoman** represents:

* **Dependability:** Performing essential work with precision.
* **Security:** Acting as a trusted protector of a specific domain.
* **Loyalty:** A system that works exclusively for the user's best interest.

## SecureYeoman Module

**SecureYeoman** is the security-hardened autonomous agent core of F.R.I.D.A.Y., inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) but built from the ground up with enterprise-grade security and comprehensive observability.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enterprise Security** | RBAC, encryption at rest, sandboxed execution, rate limiting |
| **Self-Logging** | Every task logged with cryptographic integrity verification |
| **Performance Metrics** | Real-time token usage, task duration, resource consumption |
| **GUI Dashboard** | Integrated dashboard for metrics visualization and connection management |
| **Audit Trail** | Immutable, cryptographically signed logs for compliance |
