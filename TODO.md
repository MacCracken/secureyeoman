## Phase 2.5: Core Infrastructure Gaps

**Goal**: Fill critical gaps that block dashboard and production readiness.

### Tasks

#### CLI & Startup
- [x] **P2.5-001**: CLI entry point (`packages/core/src/cli.ts`)
  - [x] Parse CLI args: `--port`, `--host`, `--config`, `--log-level`, `--help`, `--version`
  - [x] Boot SecureYeoman + gateway server
  - [x] Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
  - [x] Print startup banner with version, port, capabilities
  - [x] `bin` entry in `package.json` pointing to `./dist/cli.js`

#### Task Persistence
- [x] **P2.5-002**: SQLite task storage (`packages/core/src/task/task-storage.ts`)
  - [x] `tasks` table with indexes on status, type, created_at, correlation_id
  - [x] `TaskStorage` class following AuthStorage/SoulStorage patterns (WAL, prepared statements)
  - [x] `storeTask()`, `updateTask()`, `getTask()`, `listTasks()` with filtering + pagination
  - [x] `getStats()` for metrics (total, by_status, by_type, success_rate, avg_duration)
  - [x] 15 unit tests (`task-storage.test.ts`)

- [x] **P2.5-003**: Wire task storage into executor and gateway
  - [x] `TaskExecutor` persists tasks on create, updates on start/complete/fail
  - [x] `GET /api/v1/tasks` returns persisted tasks with filters (status, type, limit, offset)
  - [x] `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id` returns single task (404 if not found)
  - [x] `getMetrics()` populates `tasks.total`, `byStatus`, `byType`, `successRate` from storage

#### Security Events
- [x] **P2.5-004**: Security events query API
  - [x] Query audit chain entries filtered to security-relevant event types
  - [x] `GET /api/v1/security/events` returns filtered results with support for:
    - `type` param: filter by event type (auth_failure, rate_limit, injection_attempt, permission_denied, sandbox_violation, etc.)
    - `severity` param: filter by audit level
    - `from`/`to` params: time-range filtering
    - `limit`/`offset` params: pagination
  - [x] Graceful degradation when audit storage doesn't support querying

#### Rate Limit Metrics Integration
- [x] **P2.5-005**: Wire rate limiter statistics into MetricsSnapshot
  - [x] Rate limiter now tracks `totalHits` (blocked requests) and `totalChecks` (all checks)
  - [x] `getMetrics()` populates `security.blockedRequestsTotal` and `security.rateLimitHitsTotal` from live rate limiter counters
  - [x] Counters are monotonically increasing and survive cleanup cycles

#### Agent Brain (Memory/Knowledge/Skills)
- [ ] **P2.5-006**: Separate Agent Brain from Soul system
  - [ ] Create `packages/core/src/brain/` with `BrainStorage`, `BrainManager`, types, routes
  - [ ] Memory system: episodic, semantic, procedural, preference memory types
  - [ ] Knowledge base: topic-indexed entries with confidence scores and supersession tracking
  - [ ] Move skills from Soul → Brain (skills are cognitive tools, not personality)
  - [ ] SQLite `brain.db` with `memories`, `knowledge`, `brain_meta` tables
  - [ ] `BrainManager.getRelevantContext(input)` — retrieves relevant memories/knowledge for prompt injection
  - [ ] Memory decay (importance decreases for unaccessed memories) + pruning (expired memories removed)
  - [ ] Backward-compatible: existing `/api/v1/soul/skills/*` endpoints delegate to Brain
  - [ ] REST API: `/api/v1/brain/memories`, `/api/v1/brain/knowledge`, `/api/v1/brain/stats`
  - [ ] Config: `brain.enabled`, `brain.maxMemories`, `brain.memoryRetentionDays`, `brain.contextWindowMemories`
  - [ ] `SoulManager` updated to compose prompt from Soul personality + Brain context + Brain skills
  - [ ] Skill migration: auto-migrate skills from `soul.db` → `brain.db` on first run
  - [ ] 40+ unit tests for BrainStorage and BrainManager
  - See `BRAIN_SOUL_PROMPT.md` for full implementation details

#### E2E Encrypted Agent Communication
- [ ] **P2.5-007**: E2E encrypted inter-agent communication
  - [ ] Create `packages/core/src/comms/` with `AgentCrypto`, `AgentComms`, `CommsStorage`, types, routes
  - [ ] Agent keypair: X25519 (key exchange) + Ed25519 (signing), stored encrypted via SecretStore
  - [ ] Message encryption: ephemeral ECDH → HKDF → AES-256-GCM per message
  - [ ] Message signing: Ed25519 signature over ciphertext for sender authentication
  - [ ] Secret sanitization: strip API keys, tokens, passwords from all payloads before sending
  - [ ] Local message log: each agent stores its own messages (encrypted at rest in `comms.db`)
  - [ ] Peer management: register/discover other FRIDAY agents, store public keys
  - [ ] Message types: `task_request`, `task_response`, `knowledge_share`, `status_update`, `coordination`
  - [ ] REST API: `/api/v1/comms/identity`, `/api/v1/comms/peers`, `/api/v1/comms/message`, `/api/v1/comms/log`
  - [ ] Config: `comms.enabled` (default: false), `comms.maxPeers`, `comms.messageRetentionDays`
  - [ ] No secrets exposed in any inter-agent message (enforced by sanitization + tests)
  - [ ] 40+ unit tests for AgentCrypto, AgentComms, CommsStorage
  - See `BRAIN_SOUL_PROMPT.md` for full implementation details

## Phase 5: Production Hardening

**Goal**: Prepare for production deployment.

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

**Status**: Not started. Some groundwork done (structured logging, audit chain, rate limiting already in place).

### Tasks

#### Testing
- [ ] **P5-001**: Load testing
  - k6 scripts for API endpoints (health, metrics, tasks, audit, soul)
  - Sustained load tests (100 req/s for 5 min)
  - Spike tests (0 → 1000 req/s)
  - WebSocket connection scaling (100+ concurrent clients)
  - Resource monitoring during tests

- [ ] **P5-002**: Security testing
  - `pnpm audit` — dependency vulnerability scan
  - SAST scanning (ESLint security plugin or Semgrep)
  - Injection testing (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal — validate InputValidator coverage)
  - JWT token manipulation testing
  - Rate limiter bypass testing
  - Sandbox escape testing (once V2 kernel enforcement lands)

- [ ] **P5-003**: Chaos testing
  - Database corruption recovery (SQLite WAL journal)
  - Process crash and restart (verify graceful shutdown + data integrity)
  - Resource exhaustion (memory limits, disk full)
  - Concurrent access stress test

#### Deployment
- [x] **P5-004**: Docker packaging
  - [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile (build: node:20-alpine + npm, runtime: alpine + production deps)
  - [x] Docker Compose with core + dashboard services
  - [x] Health check endpoint integration (wget to /health)
  - [x] Non-root user (friday:friday)
  - [x] Volume mounts for SQLite databases (`friday-data`)
  - [x] Environment variable configuration with placeholder defaults
  - [x] `.dockerignore` for minimal build context

- [x] **P5-005**: CI/CD pipeline
  - [x] GitHub Actions: lint → typecheck → test → build → security audit → docker build
  - [x] Automated test runs on PR (Node 20 + 22 matrix)
  - [x] Docker image build on push to main/tags (no registry push)
  - [x] Coverage artifact upload
  - [ ] Release notes generation from conventional commits (deferred)

- [~] **P5-006**: Documentation
  - [x] Installation guide (from source, Docker, npm) — `docs/installation.md`
  - [x] Configuration reference (all YAML fields, env vars, CLI flags) — `docs/configuration.md`
  - [x] API documentation (REST + WebSocket reference) — `docs/api.md`
  - [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger spec generation
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] Security best practices guide

#### Monitoring
- [ ] **P5-007**: Prometheus metrics
  - `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus text format
  - Metric definitions: request_count, request_duration, task_count, token_usage, error_rate
  - Grafana dashboard JSON templates
  - Alert rules (error rate > 5%, memory > 80%, task queue depth > 50)

- [ ] **P5-008**: Logging aggregation
  - Pino structured JSON output (already done)
  - Log shipping configuration (stdout for Docker, file rotation for bare metal)
  - Example Loki/Elasticsearch config for log aggregation

## Data Models

### TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// Task
interface Task {
  id: string;
  type: TaskType;
  status: TaskStatus;
  input: Record<string, unknown>;
  output?: Record<string, unknown>;
  error?: TaskError;
  created_at: Date;
  started_at?: Date;
  completed_at?: Date;
  duration_ms?: number;
  resources: ResourceUsage;
  security_context: SecurityContext;
}

type TaskType = "execute" | "query" | "file" | "network" | "system";
type TaskStatus = "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "timeout";

// Metrics
interface Metrics {
  tasks: TaskMetrics;
  resources: ResourceMetrics;
  security: SecurityMetrics;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface TaskMetrics {
  total: number;
  by_status: Record<TaskStatus, number>;
  by_type: Record<TaskType, number>;
  success_rate: number;
  avg_duration_ms: number;
  p95_duration_ms: number;
}

interface ResourceMetrics {
  cpu_percent: number;

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Backend Runtime | Node.js 20 LTS | TypeScript support, async performance |
| Backend Framework | Fastify | Performance, schema validation |
| Frontend Framework | React 18 | Component ecosystem, concurrent features |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast HMR, modern bundling |
| State Management | TanStack Query | Cache management, real-time updates |
| Routing | react-router-dom v7 | URL routing with NavLink |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui | Customizable, accessible |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, consistent |
| Graph Visualization | ReactFlow | Interactive node graphs |
| Database | SQLite (local) | Zero-config, portable |
| Database (optional) | PostgreSQL | Scalability for multi-user |
| Testing | Vitest | Fast, Vite-native |
| E2E Testing | Playwright | Cross-browser |

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Monorepo vs Polyrepo**
   - Recommendation: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
   - Packages: `core`, `dashboard`, `plugins`
   - Shared types between backend and frontend

2. **Database Choice**
   - SQLite for single-user local deployment
   - PostgreSQL adapter for enterprise/multi-user
   - Abstract storage layer for flexibility

3. **Real-time Strategy**
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - SSE as fallback
   - Long-polling for firewall-restricted environments

4. **Authentication Strategy**
   - JWT for API authentication
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Session storage in HttpOnly cookies

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation | Priority |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Prompt injection | Input validation, instruction hierarchy | Critical |
| Sandbox escape | seccomp, Landlock, resource limits | Critical |
| Token theft | Encrypted storage, short expiry | High |
| Audit tampering | Cryptographic chain, append-only | High |
| DDoS | Rate limiting, connection limits | Medium |
| XSS | CSP headers, output encoding | Medium |
| CSRF | SameSite cookies, CSRF tokens | Medium |

### Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets encrypted at rest
- [ ] TLS 1.3 for all connections
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] RBAC enforced on all routes
- [ ] Audit logging for security events
- [ ] CSP headers configured
- [ ] Dependency audit passing
- [ ] No secrets in logs
- [ ] Sandbox escape tests passing

### Compliance Considerations

| Standard | Relevance | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| SOC 2 | High | Audit logging, access controls |
| GDPR | Medium | Data retention, right to delete |
| HIPAA | Low (unless healthcare) | Encryption, audit trails |
| PCI DSS | Low (unless payment) | N/A for most use cases |

---

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarks to Target

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| API Response Time (p95) | < 100ms | k6 load test |
| WebSocket Latency | < 50ms | Custom benchmark |
| Dashboard Load Time | < 2s | Lighthouse |
| Task Throughput | > 100/min | Stress test |
| Memory Usage (idle) | < 200MB | Process monitoring |
| Memory Usage (peak) | < 1GB | Stress test |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **API Performance**
   - Connection pooling for database
   - Response caching with ETag
   - Query optimization with EXPLAIN

2. **Frontend Performance**
   - Code splitting by route
   - Lazy loading of components
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Memoization of expensive calculations

3. **WebSocket Performance**
   - Message batching
   - Compression (permessage-deflate)
   - Connection multiplexing
