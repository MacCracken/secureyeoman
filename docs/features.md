| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Security** | RBAC (Admin/Operator/Auditor/Viewer), JWT + API key auth, mTLS, AES-256-GCM encryption at rest, sandboxed execution (Landlock/macOS sandbox), rate limiting (per-user, per-IP, global), HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), CORS policy enforcement; **ToolOutputScanner** — 18-pattern credential leak detector (OpenAI/Anthropic keys, GitHub PATs, AWS credentials, PEM private keys, DB connection strings, bearer tokens, JWTs, Slack/Stripe/Discord tokens, generic API key assignments) scans every LLM response before delivery and replaces matches with `[REDACTED:<type>]`; **Skill Trust Tiers** — community skills (`source: 'community'`) are restricted to read-only tool access (26 name-prefix allow-list), preventing shell execution, file writes, and arbitrary HTTP from unvetted skill instructions; **Outbound Credential Proxy** — `CredentialProxy` runs in the parent process and injects `Authorization` headers for known API hosts; sandboxed children receive only `http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, never the raw secret; HTTPS CONNECT tunnels enforce a per-sandbox hostname allowlist (ADR 099) |
| **Observability** | Cryptographic audit trails (HMAC-SHA256 chain), Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured JSONL log rotation, audit retention enforcement, audit export |
| **AI Integration** | Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI (local), OpenCode Zen, DeepSeek, Mistral, x.ai Grok, Letta (stateful agent platform with persistent memory); automatic fallback chains on rate limits/outages; dynamic model discovery |
| **Dashboard** | React + Vite + Tailwind; real-time WebSocket updates (channel-based RBAC); overview with stat cards (tasks, heartbeat, audit, memory) and services status panel (core, Postgres, audit chain, MCP); system flow graph (ReactFlow) with live connection edges; task history, security events, resource monitor, personality editor (Brain section shows associated skills with direct edit navigation), skills manager, code editor (Monaco), notification & retention settings; **WebGL graph visualization** (Sigma.js + graphology) with pluggable layout algorithms — ForceAtlas2 for hub-and-spoke peer networks, Dagre hierarchical layout for delegation trees and DAGs; **rich chat rendering** — assistant messages rendered as full Markdown with syntax-highlighted code (Prism, dark/light theme-aware), interactive Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math expressions, GitHub-style alert callouts, task list checkboxes, and styled tables; **real-time collaborative editing** — personality system prompts and skill instructions use Yjs CRDT over a binary `/ws/collab` WebSocket; **presence indicators** — `PresenceBanner` shows who else is editing the same field in real time (colored dots + name label); **Group Chat view** (`/group-chat`) — unified three-pane channel list + message thread + reply box aggregating all connected integrations, with personality tracking per message; **Cross-Integration Routing Rules** — visual rule builder embedded in the Connections page (Routing Rules tab) for priority-ordered rules that forward, reply, override personality, or notify webhooks across integrations |
| **Agent Architecture** | Soul (identity/archetypes/personality), Spirit (passions/inspirations/pains), Brain (memory/knowledge/skills with decay & pruning, vector semantic search via FAISS/Qdrant/ChromaDB, LLM-powered memory consolidation), Body (heartbeat/vital signs/screen capture, per-personality capabilities: vision, auditory, vocalization, limb movement, haptic; **per-personality active hours** — configurable rest schedule suppresses heartbeat checks and proactive triggers outside the defined window); **Personality Presets** — built-in selectable templates (`FRIDAY` general assistant, `T.Ron` security watchdog) instantiated via `GET /api/v1/soul/personalities/presets` + `POST .../presets/:id/instantiate` |
| **Cognitive Architecture** | Vector semantic memory (local SentenceTransformers + OpenAI/Gemini API embeddings), FAISS, Qdrant, and ChromaDB vector backends, LLM-powered memory consolidation with on-save dedup and scheduled deep analysis, 3-tier progressive history compression (message → topic → bulk) with AI summarization; **Hybrid FTS + RRF search** — `tsvector` GIN index on `brain.memories` + `brain.knowledge` merged with pgvector via Reciprocal Rank Fusion, improving recall for exact terms and named entities; **Content-chunked indexing** — large documents split into 800-token overlapping chunks with independent FTS + vector indexes; **Proactive context compaction** — token-usage estimated before each LLM call, older turns summarised at 80% context-window fill to prevent overflow; **Self-repairing task loop** — `TaskLoop` detects stuck agents (timeout or repeated tool calls) and injects diagnostic recovery prompts |
| **Extensions** | 38 lifecycle hook points (observe/transform/veto semantics), TypeScript plugin modules with filesystem discovery, EventEmitter integration, outbound webhook dispatch with HMAC signing, hot-reload support |
| **Code Execution** | Sandboxed code execution (Python, Node.js, shell) within Landlock/seccomp sandbox, persistent sessions, streaming output via WebSocket, approval policies (manual/auto/session-trust), streaming secrets filter, full audit trail |
| **A2A Protocol** | Agent-to-Agent cross-instance delegation via E2E encrypted messaging, peer discovery (mDNS/DNS-SD/static), capability negotiation, trust progression (untrusted/verified/trusted), remote delegation in unified delegation tree |
| **Multi-Agent Architecture** | Sub-agent delegation system with role-based profiles (researcher, coder, analyst, reviewer, summarizer); Agent Swarms with named templates and three strategies — `sequential` (context-chaining pipeline), `parallel` (`Promise.all` + optional coordinator synthesis), `dynamic` (coordinator-driven, uses `delegate_task` internally); `create_swarm` MCP tool; 4 built-in templates; dashboard Swarms tab; **Dynamic Tool Creation** — agents can generate and register new tools at runtime (Agent Zero-style), gated by `allowDynamicTools` security policy with `sandboxDynamicTools` isolation; **Extensible sub-agent types** — `llm` (agentic loop), `binary` (spawn external process via JSON stdin/stdout, zero token cost, gated by `allowBinaryAgents`), `mcp-bridge` (call MCP tool directly with Mustache template, zero token cost); **Intelligent Model Routing** — heuristic task profiler selects the cheapest appropriate model per delegation (fast tier for summarise/classify/extract, capable tier for code/reason/plan), cost-aware swarm scheduling injects model overrides per role, `POST /api/v1/model/estimate-cost` provides pre-execution cost estimates with cheaper-alternative suggestions |
| **Integrations** | 31 platforms — Telegram (inline keyboards, document attachments), Discord (threads, modals, slash command registration via REST), Slack (Block Kit actions, modal dialogs, Workflow Builder steps), GitHub (PR review automation, issue auto-labeling, code search triggers), GitLab, Google Chat, Gmail, Email (IMAP/SMTP), Google Calendar, Notion, Jira, AWS, Azure DevOps, Linear, Airtable, DingTalk, LINE, QQ, Signal, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Twitter/X, Spotify, Stripe, YouTube, Zapier, Figma, Todoist, iMessage, CLI, Generic Webhook — plugin architecture with unified message routing |
