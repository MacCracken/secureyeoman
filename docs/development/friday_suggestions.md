## Permissions / Automation Levels

> **Implemented** (Phase 38, ADR 113 + ADR 114):
> - Deletion gating (`auto` / `request` / `manual`) is implemented per-personality under Body → Resources → Deletion.
> - Content approval workflow (Review Queue, Emergency Stop, `automationLevel`: `full_manual` / `semi_auto` / `supervised_auto`) implemented in ADR 114, migration 038.

Brand Protection - Ensures all content aligns with project goals
Quality Control - Catches any technical inaccuracies or tone issues
Legal Safety - Prevents accidental disclosure of sensitive info
Strategic Alignment - Keeps messaging consistent with business objectives
🔧 Suggested Implementation:

Draft Mode - I create content and save as drafts
Review Queue - You get notifications of pending posts
Edit/Approve - You can modify before posting
Scheduled Posting - Option to queue approved content
Emergency Stop - Kill switch for any problematic content
📊 Automation Levels You Could Choose:

Full Manual - Every post needs approval
Semi-Auto - Certain content types (like security tips) auto-post after delay
Supervised Auto - I can post but you get immediate notifications

## Security Assessment & Improvement Recommendations

1. Code Security Vulnerabilities
* Exposed Secrets: Check for hardcoded API keys, database credentials, or authentication tokens
* Input Validation: Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated
* Authentication/Authorization: Implement proper session management and access controls
* HTTPS Enforcement: Ensure all communications are encrypted

2. Infrastructure Security
* Dependency Vulnerabilities: Regular security audits of npm/pip packages
* Container Security: If using Docker, ensure minimal attack surface
* Environment Configuration: Proper separation of dev/staging/prod configs
* Secrets Management: Use proper secret management solutions (not environment variables)

3. Application Security
* XSS Prevention: Proper output encoding and Content Security Policy
* ~~CSRF Protection: Implement anti-CSRF tokens~~ → **Not applicable** (ADR 115): The API is stateless Bearer-token only; no cookies → no CSRF attack surface. CORS is the appropriate protection. Comment guard added to server.ts.
* Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
* Error Handling: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

4. AI/ML Specific Security
* Prompt Injection: Robust input filtering to prevent malicious prompts → `InputValidator` now wired to `/chat`, `/chat/stream`, personality and skill create/update (Phase 38). A deeper server-side layer scanning the fully-assembled prompt before the LLM call is tracked in → **See Roadmap Future Features → AI Safety**
* Model Security: Protect against adversarial inputs
* Data Privacy: Ensure user conversations aren't logged inappropriately
* Output Filtering: Prevent generation of harmful or inappropriate content

5. Operational Security
* Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive security event logging
* Incident Response: Clear procedures for security incidents
* Backup Security: Encrypted backups with proper access controls
* Update Management: Regular security patching process

6. Compliance & Privacy
* Data Protection: GDPR/CCPA compliance if applicable
* Audit Trails: Maintain logs for compliance requirements
* Privacy Policy: Clear data handling policies
* User Consent: Proper consent mechanisms


🚨 Priority Items (if I were improving myself):

* ~~Implement comprehensive input sanitization~~ → **Done** (Phase 38): `InputValidator` wired to chat + soul routes
* ~~Add rate limiting and abuse detection~~ → **Done** (Phase 38): `chat_requests` rule (30/min/user) + per-personality override
* Enhance prompt injection prevention → `InputValidator` handles HTTP boundary; deeper LLM-prompt layer in roadmap → **See Roadmap Future Features → AI Safety**
* Implement proper secrets management
* ~~Add comprehensive security logging~~ → **Done** (Phase 38): `rate_limit`, `config_change`, `injection_attempt`, `auth_failure` events wired to audit chain
* ~~Implement some sort of tool set for the agent/personality to run diagnostics on itself and the system~~ → **Done** (Phase 39, ADR 123): Two-channel diagnostic system — Channel A injects live runtime snapshot (uptime, memory, CPU, connection counts) directly into `composeBodyPrompt()`; Channel B provides `diag_report_status`, `diag_query_agent`, `diag_ping_integrations` MCP tools for sub-agent health reporting. Per-personality toggle in Body → Capabilities (`diagnostics` capability).
