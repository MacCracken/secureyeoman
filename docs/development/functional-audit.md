# Competitive Analysis

> Last updated: **2026-03-18** | SecureYeoman **v2026.3.18**

---

## Executive Summary

SecureYeoman is the only enterprise-grade, self-hosted AI agent platform that ships RBAC, SSO/SAML, multi-tenancy, cryptographic audit trails, Vault integration, OPA/CEL governance, DLP, Firecracker microVM sandboxing, GPU-aware privacy routing, and Kubernetes Helm in a single ~123 MB binary deployable fully air-gapped.

No competitor matches this combination. The closest — Ironclaw — leads on Rust memory safety and TEE hardware attestation but requires NEAR AI Cloud infrastructure (no air-gap) and lacks RBAC, SSO, multi-agent orchestration, and a dashboard. NemoClaw addresses OpenClaw's security gap with NVIDIA-branded sandboxing but inherits its lack of RBAC, SSO, multi-tenancy, DAG workflows, and training pipeline — and now has 17 Fortune 500 launch partners making it the primary enterprise distribution threat. OpenAI Frontier offers enterprise governance but is cloud-hosted with limited availability and no data sovereignty.

Since v2026.3.12, SecureYeoman has completed a comprehensive 3-round security audit (30+ fixes), Shruti DAW integration (10 MCP tools, voice bridge, HTTP client), agent parent registration with delegated auth/knowledge/audit forwarding, agent binary build & distribution (Docker, multi-arch), full-stack `exposeEdgeTools` toggle wiring, Firecracker microVM sandbox (KVM isolation, rootfs builder, jailer, vsock, snapshots, TAP network isolation), GPU-aware inference routing (GpuProbe, LocalModelRegistry, PrivacyRouter with per-personality routing policy), and AGNOS bridge with profile-based tool exposure.

## Competitors

**OpenClaw** (~250K stars) — Most popular agent by adoption. Surpassed React on GitHub in March 2026 to become the most-starred software project. Severe ongoing security crisis: 13+ CVEs (20+ GHSAs) including RCE (CVE-2026-25253, CVSS 8.8), path traversal (CVE-2026-28462, CVSS 8.7), account takeover + RCE via Direct Connections (CVE-2025-64496, CVSS 7.3), ClawJacked WebSocket hijack, command injection, SSRF, ACP auto-approval bypass, webhook forgery, log poisoning, and stored DOM XSS. 1,184+ malicious skills in ClawHub (ClawHavoc, 12% of all listings). Moltbook platform breach: 35,000 emails + 1.5M agent API tokens exposed. 42,000+ publicly exposed instances (Bitsight/Censys Jan-Feb 2026; 5,194 verified vulnerable, 93.4% auth bypass). Gartner rated it "unacceptable cybersecurity risk." Microsoft published security guidance: "Running OpenClaw safely" (Feb 19, 2026). Creator Peter Steinberger joined OpenAI (Feb 14, 2026); project transitioning to open-source foundation. v2026.3.8 adds ACP provenance, backup tool, and 12+ security patches. $300-750/month typical API cost. Unrestricted host access by default. Android native app added.

**NemoClaw** (NVIDIA) — Open-source enterprise security wrapper around OpenClaw, announced at GTC 2026 (March 16). 17 launch partners: Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Siemens, Cisco, CrowdStrike, Google Cloud, and more. Bundles NVIDIA OpenShell runtime for process-level sandboxing (filesystem isolation, network policy, syscall blocking via YAML-based declarative security policies with live policy updates and full audit trails), Privacy Router using differential privacy technology (acquired from Gretel) to strip PII before sending data to external services, and local Nemotron model execution on NVIDIA GPUs (GeForce RTX, RTX PRO, DGX Spark/Station). Hardware-agnostic — works regardless of GPU vendor. Not model-exclusive — works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. Installs in a single command on top of OpenClaw. **High threat** to SY because it addresses OpenClaw's biggest weakness (security) while leveraging NVIDIA's brand, GPU ecosystem, and 17 Fortune 500 launch partnerships. However, it inherits OpenClaw's architecture (no RBAC, SSO, multi-tenancy, DAG workflows, dashboard, or training pipeline), provides only infrastructure-level sandboxing (no content guardrails, DLP, or governance), and cannot operate air-gapped without GPU hardware. No formal compliance posture (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001). Enterprise extensions (compliance, support SLAs) planned as paid tier.

**Ironclaw** (~4K stars) — Rust, NEAR AI. Launched at NEARCON 2026 alongside Confidential GPU Marketplace. TEE + WASM execution. AES-256-GCM encryption. PostgreSQL storage with comprehensive audit log. Free Starter tier (1 hosted agent) with paid tiers for scaling. Cannot self-host air-gapped (requires NEAR AI Cloud). No RBAC, SSO, K8s, multi-agent orchestration, or dashboard.

**PicoClaw** (~22.8K stars) — Go binary, 10-20 MB, < 1 s startup on $10 hardware. MCP client in v0.2.0. Added Telegram, Discord, QQ, DingTalk, LINE, WeCom, and Slack integrations. New agent memory system, cron scheduler, ClawdChat social network, and security sandbox. Growing fast but still early development — no RBAC, persistent memory, or production security guarantees.

**Agent Zero** (~16.2K stars) — Python framework, major v0.9.8 release with new Skills framework (replacing Instruments), WebSocket sync, MCP client + server, complete UI redesign with process groups, message queue, and Git projects. Voice interaction added: Kokoro TTS + Whisper STT. Enhanced attachment system. Four new LLM providers. Subordinate agent extensibility with dedicated prompts and tools. No enterprise features (RBAC, SSO, encryption). Docker, 4 GB minimum.

**TrustClaw** — Cloud-native OpenClaw fork with 1,000+ tools, OAuth authentication, and sandboxed cloud execution. All execution in cloud — nothing runs locally. Trades one cloud dependency for two. Keys still pass through a third party — fails data residency for regulated industries. Limited infrastructure visibility problematic for compliance demonstration.

**Manus AI** — Was a $100M ARR cloud agent; acquired by Meta (~$2B, Dec 2025). Now being integrated into Meta Ads Manager (Feb 2026). China regulatory probe launched into export control compliance; founders could face criminal charges; deal could be unwound. Customer flight reported post-acquisition (CNBC Jan 2026). Data now flows through Meta infrastructure. Zero-viable for GDPR/HIPAA organizations. No longer a standalone competitor — effectively a Meta internal advertising tool.

**OpenAI Frontier** — Enterprise agent platform (Feb 2026). Vendor-agnostic: supports OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic agents. On-premises, enterprise cloud, and OpenAI-hosted runtime options. AWS distribution deal ($110B round, Amazon exclusive third-party cloud distributor). Business context integration (CRM, data warehouses, ticketing). Enterprise IAM with scoped agent identities. Early customers: HP, Oracle, State Farm, Uber, Intuit, Thermo Fisher. Currently limited availability.

**Devin 2.0** — AI coding agent, price dropped from $500 to $20/mo ($2.00-2.25 per Agent Compute Unit). Acquired Windsurf IDE (July 2025, ~$250M; Cognition valued at $10.2B post-acquisition; combined ARR doubled). Google hired Windsurf CEO/co-founder in a $2.4B reverse-acquihire; Cognition acquired remaining team, IP, product, trademark, and 350+ enterprise customers. New features: Interactive Planning, Devin Wiki (auto-generated architecture docs), Devin Review (intelligent PR analysis), Devin Search (agentic codebase exploration). 83% more tasks per ACU vs v1. Windsurf brings SOC 2 Type II, SSO, RBAC, hybrid deployment, and ZDR (zero data retention) at Enterprise tier. Cloud-only, single-agent, code-specific.

**OpenHands** — OSS code agent (MIT), v1.4.0 (Feb 2026). Raised $18.8M. New Planning Agent with Plan Mode / Code Mode switching. Claims 87% of bug tickets resolved same day. SDK for composable agents (local or 1000s in cloud). CLI powered by Claude/GPT/any LLM. Kubernetes-native. Strongest OSS alternative for coding workflows. Minimal enterprise features.

**ZeroClaw** — Rust-based edge AI runtime. 3.4 MB binary, <5 MB RAM, sub-10ms cold starts. Runs on $10 Raspberry Pi. Swappable provider traits (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter). Secure by design with pairing, strict sandboxing, explicit allowlists, and workspace scoping. 98% cheaper to operate than standard runtimes. Early stage, minimal features.

## Known Gaps

### Competitive Gaps

| Gap | Leader | SY status |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Community skill volume | OpenClaw (13,729 ClawHub) | 87 community + 24 builtin (Trust Tier advantage offsets volume gap) |
| Native mobile app | OpenClaw (Android) | Web/CLI only; Capacitor scaffold exists (roadmap Tier 3); PWA planned but not priority |
| Ultra-low resource / edge | PicoClaw (10-20 MB, < 1 s) / ZeroClaw (3.4 MB, sub-10ms) | Lite binary 123 MB — design trade-off for enterprise features; planned slim-IoT/edge variant targets sub-10 s |
| TEE hardware attestation | Ironclaw (NEAR AI Cloud) | Not applicable (local-first, no cloud dependency) |
| Startup time | PicoClaw (< 1 s) / ZeroClaw (sub-10ms) | ~30 s — conditional module loading helps; further reduction not feasible without slim-IoT/edge variant |
| Enterprise brand / distribution | NemoClaw (17 Fortune 500 partners), OpenAI Frontier (HP, Oracle, Uber) | Self-hosted niche; no cloud sales force |
| Formal security certification | Windsurf/Cursor (SOC 2 Type II) | Compliance SoA generator covers NIST/SOC 2/ISO 27001/HIPAA/EU AI Act — no formal cert |
| Agentic code search | Devin Search, Cursor, OpenHands | Knowledge search exists; no code-specific agentic search |

### Consumer Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| No one-click cloud deploy templates | High barrier for non-DevOps users; every consumer competitor offers zero-setup | Planned — Railway, Render, DigitalOcean templates |
| No conversation share/export UX | Users cannot share chats or download history from dashboard; export exists only via training API (`POST /api/v1/training/export`) | Planned — dashboard share link + download-as-markdown/JSON |
| No web push notifications | Notification system uses WebSocket + external fan-out (Slack/email); browser must be open to receive | Low priority — WebSocket covers primary use case |

### Enterprise Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| ~~No SCIM provisioning~~ | ~~Enterprise IT expects automated user lifecycle~~ | **Shipped** (v2026.3.13) — SCIM 2.0 Users + Groups provisioning |
| ~~No per-tenant rate limiting / token budgets~~ | ~~Rate limiter is global rules only~~ | **Shipped** (v2026.3.13) — per-tenant quotas and token budgets |
| ~~No break-glass / emergency access~~ | ~~No documented recovery when admin is locked out~~ | **Shipped** (v2026.3.13) — break-glass emergency access with sealed recovery key and audit trail |
| ~~No access review / entitlement reporting~~ | ~~RBAC audit logs exist but no "who has access to what" report~~ | **Shipped** (v2026.3.13) — access review campaigns + entitlement reporting |
| ~~No formal compliance audit scope docs~~ | ~~Compliance mapping code covers 5 frameworks~~ | **Shipped** (v2026.3.13) — compliance SoA generator (NIST, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, EU AI Act) |
| No public status page | SLO monitoring and health endpoints exist internally; no customer-facing uptime/status dashboard | Low priority |
| No per-tenant data residency enforcement | Multi-region HA with `allowContentReplication` flag exists; no per-tenant region locking for GDPR | Future consideration |

### Feature Matrix Coverage Gap

The feature matrix (above) covers 5 primary competitors. The 7 new 2026 entrants (TrustClaw, Manus/Meta, OpenAI Frontier, Devin 2.0, OpenHands, ZeroClaw, NanoBot) are described in prose but absent from the comparison table. Adding columns would make the matrix unwieldy; a separate "new entrants" mini-matrix may be warranted as these products mature.

### Pricing & Cost Advantage

SecureYeoman is self-hosted, BYOK (bring-your-own-keys), with $0 infrastructure cost for fully local models (Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI). Users only pay for the license — not for platform hosting, API markup, or per-seat cloud fees.

**Planned pricing:**

| Tier | Price | Target | Includes |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Community** | Free | Hobbyists, evaluators | Core platform, 13+ LLM providers, CLI, dashboard, community skills |
| **Pro** | $20/yr | Developers, power users | + Advanced brain, provider management, computer use, custom integrations, prompt engineering, batch inference |
| **Solopreneur** | $100/yr | Solo operators, consultants, small teams | All enterprise features for individuals — SSO, DLP, governance, training pipeline, federated learning, full orchestration |
| **Enterprise** | $1,000/yr | Organizations, regulated industries | All features + multi-tenancy, dedicated support channels, SLA guarantees, compliance assistance |
| **Support** | Additional | All paid tiers | Priority support, onboarding assistance, custom integration help — priced separately based on scope |

SY is BYOK — users bring their own API keys and run on their own infrastructure. SecureYeoman does not proxy, meter, or markup AI calls. This means near-zero marginal cost per user, enabling aggressive pricing that cloud-hosted competitors cannot match.

**Competitive comparison:**

| Platform | Monthly cost | What you get | Data sovereignty |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **SecureYeoman Pro** | $20/yr ($10/yr) | Full self-hosted platform + BYOK | Complete — your infra |
| **Devin 2.0** | $20/mo ($240/yr) | Cloud coding agent only, per-ACU billing | None — Cognition cloud |
| **OpenClaw** | $300-750 (API costs) | Personal agent, no enterprise features, 13+ CVEs | Partial — keys transit host |
| **OpenAI Frontier** | Enterprise pricing (undisclosed) | Cloud/on-prem agent platform | Partial — AWS distribution |
| **Manus AI (Meta)** | Unknown | Cloud agent, Meta infrastructure | None — Meta cloud |

The Pro tier at $20/yr vs Devin's $20/mo ($480 over the same period) is a 24x price advantage — possible because SY has no AI compute costs to recoup. The Solopreneur tier is unique in the market — no competitor offers enterprise-grade governance (SSO, DLP, OPA/CEL, cryptographic audit, training pipeline) to individuals at $100/yr. This directly targets consultants and freelancers serving regulated clients who need compliance posture without enterprise contracts.

## Market Positioning

| Segment | Position | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Enterprise self-hosted** | **Leader** | Only platform combining full security + governance + orchestration + deployment stack |
| **Developer automation** | Challenger | OpenClaw leads on community; Devin at $20/mo captures individuals; OpenHands raised $18.8M; SY leads on security posture |
| **Privacy-first** | **Co-leader** | Ironclaw: Rust + TEE. SY: feature breadth + enterprise auth + air-gap + dashboard |
| **Embedded / IoT** | Challenger | PicoClaw + ZeroClaw lead on constraints; SY Lite available |
| **Managed SaaS** | Not positioned | Self-hosted by design; Frontier + Manus/Meta own this segment |

### Adjacent Competitors (Code-Specific)

These are primarily coding tools, not general agent platforms, but overlap with SY's developer workflow features:

- **Cursor** — AI-native IDE. Closed source. Pricing: Free / $20/mo Pro / $40/user/mo Teams / Enterprise custom. SOC 2 Type II, SCIM 2.0, audit logs, SSO, RBAC. 20,000+ developers at Salesforce alone. MCP support via extensions. Cloud-only. Not a general agent platform but demonstrates enterprise AI tooling expectations.
- **Cline** (~59.1K stars, 5M+ VS Code installs) — Open-source VS Code AI coding agent (BYOK). MCP marketplace. 4 security vulnerabilities disclosed Aug 2025 (API key exfiltration, arbitrary code execution, data leakage); only partially mitigated as of v3.35.0. No enterprise features. Individual developer tool.
- **Windsurf** — Now part of Cognition/Devin (acquired July 2025). See Devin 2.0 entry. Enterprise features: SOC 2 Type II, SSO, RBAC, hybrid deployment, ZDR. Pricing: Free / $15/mo Pro / $30/user/mo Teams / $60/user/mo Enterprise.

**The sovereignty argument**: Every competitor claiming "enterprise-ready" while routing data through its own cloud reinforces SecureYeoman's position. OpenAI Frontier's AWS deal and Manus's Meta acquisition concentrate data in hyperscaler infrastructure — the opposite of sovereignty. The answer to "easier setup" is `curl -fsSL https://secureyeoman.ai/install | bash`. The answer to "bigger brand" is vendor lock-in and 13 providers including fully local models. The answer to "more secure" is: your key material never leaves your perimeter.
