## Phase 1: Foundation

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: 3 weeks

- TypeScript project structure with strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest
- Configuration management (YAML + env vars + Zod validation)
- Base agent loop with task queue, event-driven architecture, graceful shutdown
- Multi-provider AI integration (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, OpenCode Zen)
- Structured logging with UUID v7, correlation IDs, SQLite WAL storage
- Cryptographic audit chain (HMAC-SHA256, integrity verification)
- Log query API with REST endpoint

---

## Phase 2: Security Layer

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: 4 weeks

### Authentication & Authorization
- RBAC with role definitions (Admin, Operator, Auditor, Viewer), inheritance, persistent storage
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation, blacklisting
- API key authentication with rate limiting and revocation
- Gateway middleware for per-route RBAC enforcement

### Encryption & Secrets
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with scrypt KDF
- System keyring integration (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- Secret rotation with dual-key JWT verification and grace periods

### Input Validation & Protection
- Input validation pipeline (size limits, encoding normalization, injection detection)
- Prompt injection defense (6 pattern families, blocking + warning modes)
- Rate limiting with sliding window counters (per-user, per-IP, per-API-key, global)

### Sandboxing
- Cross-platform sandbox abstraction (`Sandbox` interface, `SandboxManager`)
- Linux: V1 soft sandbox + V2 Landlock kernel enforcement via forked worker
- macOS: `sandbox-exec` profile generation with deny-default policy
- NoopSandbox fallback with warning

### Additional
- Soul system (personality, skills, onboarding, 18 REST endpoints)
- mTLS with client certificate authentication
- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting

---

## Phase 2.5: Core Infrastructure Gaps

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: 1 week

- CLI entry point (`--port`, `--host`, `--config`, `--log-level`, `--tls`)
- SQLite task storage with filtering, pagination, and metrics
- Security events query API
- Rate limit metrics integration
- Brain system (memory, knowledge, skills with decay and pruning)
- E2E encrypted inter-agent communication (X25519 + Ed25519 + AES-256-GCM)
- Model fallback chain on rate limits (429) / provider unavailability (502/503)

---

## Phase 3: Dashboard

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: 5 weeks

- React + Vite + TypeScript with URL routing (react-router-dom v7)
- TanStack Query for server-state management
- WebSocket client with auto-reconnection and channel subscriptions
- MetricsGraph (ReactFlow with custom node types and real-time updates)
- TaskHistory with advanced filtering (status + type), live data
- SecurityEvents with severity-based styling, live data
- ConnectionManager with connect forms, start/stop/delete, error retry
- ResourceMonitor with CPU/Memory gauges, token/cost tracking, real history
- Soul/Personality UI (onboarding wizard, personality editor, skills manager)
- Login page with JWT auth, automatic token refresh on 401
- Session timeout warning, ErrorBoundary, ConfirmDialog
- Responsive mobile layout (hamburger nav, stacked cards, adaptive header/footer spacing)
- Theme toggle (dark/light with localStorage persistence)
- Settings page (agent identity, API key management, soul config overview)
- DashboardLayout, StatusBar (inline reconnecting indicator), collapsible sidebar navigation (v1.2)
- 57 component tests across 5 files (Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom)

---

## Phase 4: Integrations

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: 4 weeks

- Plugin architecture (`Integration` interface, `IntegrationManager`, `IntegrationStorage`, factory pattern)
- Message abstraction (`UnifiedMessage`, `MessageAttachment`, `PlatformAdapter`, `MessageRouter`)
- REST API routes for CRUD + start/stop + messages with RBAC
- Telegram adapter (grammy, long-polling, `/start`/`help`/`status` commands, 23 tests)
- Discord adapter (discord.js v14, slash commands, embeds, 19 tests)
- Slack adapter (Slack Bolt, socket mode, slash commands, 18 tests)
- GitHub adapter (Octokit, webhook handler, signature verification, 17 tests)
- Conversation management, auto-reconnect, per-platform rate limiting
- 24 integration framework tests

---

## Phase 5: Production Hardening

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: 3 weeks

- Docker packaging (multi-stage Dockerfile, docker-compose, non-root user, healthcheck)
- CI/CD pipeline (lint, typecheck, test, build, security audit, docker build; Node 20+22 matrix)
- Load testing (k6 scripts: API endpoints, auth flow, WebSocket, task creation)
- Security testing (injection, JWT manipulation, rate limit bypass, RBAC, audit integrity; 63 tests)
- Chaos testing (database corruption, crash recovery, resource exhaustion; 13 tests)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint with Grafana dashboard and alert rules
- Log aggregation (append-only JSONL file writer, log rotation with gzip, Loki + Promtail)
- Documentation (getting started, configuration, API, OpenAPI 3.1, troubleshooting, deployment, integrations, security testing)
