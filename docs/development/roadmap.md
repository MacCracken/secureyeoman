## Phase XX: Find & Repair (Ongoing)

**Status**: Ongoing

Continuous bug discovery and repair pass — no fixed scope. As real-world usage surfaces regressions or rough edges, they are filed here, fixed, and moved to the Changelog. This phase never closes; it rolls forward with the project.

### Open Items

- [ ] **Manual test: Per-Personality Memory Scoping** — End-to-end verification of ADR 134. Steps: (1) Chat with T.Ron → save a memory, confirm it appears in T.Ron recall but NOT in FRIDAY recall; (2) Check heartbeat stats show different Memories counts for T.Ron and FRIDAY; (3) Enable Omnipresent Mind on FRIDAY → confirm FRIDAY can now recall T.Ron's memories; (4) Disable Omnipresent Mind → scoping restored; (5) Verify `/api/v1/brain/stats?personalityId=<id>` returns per-personality counts. *(No automated DB integration test yet)*
- [ ] **Manual test: One Skill Schema + Community Marketplace** — End-to-end verification of ADR 135. Steps: (1) Dashboard → Marketplace → confirm All / Marketplace / Community filter tabs render; (2) Sync community skills via `POST /api/v1/marketplace/community/sync` with a local repo path; (3) Switch to Community tab → confirm community skills appear with "Community" badge; (4) Install a community skill that has `mcpToolsAllowed` set → confirm the brain skill record carries the same `mcpToolsAllowed` value; (5) Dashboard → Skills → Installed tab → confirm the installed community skill shows "Community" in the Source column; (6) Uninstall the skill → confirm `installed` resets to false and card returns to "Install" state.
- [ ] **Manual test: SAML SP flow** — Configure SimpleSAMLphp (or mock). (1) `GET /api/v1/auth/sso/saml/:id/metadata` returns valid `<md:EntityDescriptor>` XML. (2) `GET /api/v1/auth/sso/authorize/:id` redirects to IdP with SAMLRequest. (3) Post-IdP redirect hits ACS, returns JWT in URL fragment.
- [ ] **Manual test: RLS tenant isolation** — Create tenant B via API. Insert `soul.personality` scoped to tenant B. Query personalities as tenant A → empty. Query as tenant B → record visible. Existing default-tenant data unaffected.
- [ ] **Base knowledge generic entries need per-personality review** — `hierarchy`, `purpose`, and `interaction` are currently seeded globally. These may need per-personality variants (e.g., T.Ron's purpose may differ from FRIDAY's). Low urgency — global entries are contextually correct for now.
- [ ] **Consumer UX: Settings page split** — Extract `<AuditChainTab>`, `<SoulSystemTab>`, `<RateLimitingTab>` from the `SettingsPage.tsx` monolith.
- [ ] **Manual test: OAuth token refresh end-to-end** — (1) Connect a Gmail account; (2) Wait for access token to expire (or use Connections → OAuth → "Refresh Token" button); (3) Confirm personality can still call `gmail_profile` without error; (4) Revoke the Google refresh token in Google Account → Security → Third-party apps, then trigger a Gmail tool call — confirm error message tells user to reconnect (not a silent 500). *(401-retry + forceRefreshById now implemented, 2026-02-27c)*

---

## Phase 64: AI Training Pipeline — Future Items

*Core pipeline complete (2026-02-27). See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).*

- [ ] **Continual / online learning** — Incremental adapter updates from new interactions without a full retrain. Replay buffer management, LR scheduling, drift detection. Research-grade; revisit once fine-tuning pipeline has real-world usage.
- [ ] **Training from scratch** — Pre-train on a curated local corpus. Scoped to small models (≤3B params) as lightweight specialists. Depends on fine-tuning pipeline being battle-tested.

---

## Phase 65: Voice & Community

**Status**: Demand-Gated — implement when voice profile and marketplace demand justifies the investment.

### Voice Profiles

- [ ] **Voice profile system** — Named voice identities (`voice_profile_create`, `voice_profile_list`, `voice_profile_speak` MCP tools) backed by Voicebox profiles. Each personality can have a persistent voice identity.
- [ ] **Two-tier voice prompt caching** — Cache Voicebox voice prompts in memory (session) and on disk (MD5 keyed on audio bytes + reference text), avoiding reprocessing reference audio on every TTS call.

### Marketplace Evolution

*Implement once the community skill repo has meaningful scale.*

- [ ] **Scheduled Auto-Sync** — Optional cron-style background sync from the configured community repo (configurable interval, off by default).
- [ ] **Hosted Discovery API** — A lightweight read-only API for browsing available community skills without cloning.
- [ ] **Cryptographic Skill Signing** — Authors sign skills with a keypair; SecureYeoman verifies signatures before installing. Reject unsigned skills in strict mode.
- [ ] **Skill Ratings & Downloads** — Community feedback mechanism (stars, download counts) surfaced in the marketplace UI.

---

## Phase 66: Native Clients

**Status**: Demand-Gated — implement once REST/WebSocket API is stable and adoption justifies native packaging.

### Mobile

- [ ] **Mobile app** — Native iOS/Android companion app. Primary view: chat interface + at-a-glance overview stats. Connects to existing REST + WebSocket API.
- [ ] **Cross-device sync** — Conversation history, personality state, and notification preferences synced across devices.

### Desktop

- [ ] **Desktop app** — Native desktop client (Electron or Tauri) wrapping the existing dashboard SPA. Adds system tray, native notifications, global keyboard shortcut, and auto-launch on login.
- [ ] **Offline indicator** — Detect when the connected SecureYeoman instance is unreachable.
- [ ] **Auto-update** — In-app update flow via the platform's native update mechanism.

---

## Phase 67: Infrastructure & Platform

**Status**: Demand-Gated — implement once operational scale or compliance requirements justify the investment.

### Encryption

- [ ] **HSM Integration** — Hardware Security Module integration for key management.

### Collaboration

- [ ] **Optimistic Locking** — `version` field on personalities and skills; API returns `409 Conflict` on stale saves; dashboard shows "Someone else edited this — reload?" banner.

### Graph Rendering

*Revisit once delegation trees and peer networks grow beyond a few dozen nodes and Dagre's static layout proves limiting.*

- [ ] **ELK Integration** — Eclipse Layout Kernel for advanced constraint-based layouts. ~2 MB WASM bundle — justified only when graph complexity outgrows Dagre.
