# Edge/IoT Binary

Deploy SecureYeoman to edge and IoT devices with `secureyeoman-edge` — a static Go binary at 7.2 MB with zero runtime dependencies. Runs on any Linux target including the 10 MB AGNOS edge container.

---

## Installation

### Install script (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.secureyeoman.dev | bash -s -- --edge
```

This downloads the correct binary for your architecture (amd64, arm64, or armv7) and places it in `/usr/local/bin/`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maccracken/secureyeoman.git
cd secureyeoman
./scripts/build-binary.sh --edge
# Outputs: dist/secureyeoman-edge-linux-{amd64,arm64,armv7}
```

Cross-compilation uses `CGO_ENABLED=0` for fully static binaries.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled through environment variables and CLI flags. CLI flags take precedence.

| Env Var | CLI Flag | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_PORT` | `--port` | `18891` | Listen port |
| `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_HOST` | `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_LOG_LEVEL` | `--log-level` | `info` | Log level (debug/info/warn/error) |
| `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_PARENT_URL` | `--parent-url` | — | Parent instance URL |
| `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_API_TOKEN` | — | — | Bearer token for auth (required) |
| `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` | `--registration-token` | — | Token for A2A registration |

LLM and messaging providers auto-configure from standard env vars (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_HOST`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
export SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_API_TOKEN="your-secret-token"

# Start the edge node
secureyeoman-edge start --port 18891 --parent-url https://hub.example.com

# In another terminal, verify it's running
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" http://localhost:18891/health
```

---

## A2A Registration

Edge nodes participate in SecureYeoman's Agent-to-Agent network as peers with heartbeat and trust levels.

### Register with a parent instance

```bash
secureyeoman-edge register \
  --parent-url https://hub.example.com \
  --registration-token "token-from-parent"
```

On first connection, the edge node pins the parent's TLS certificate using TOFU (Trust On First Use). The SHA-256 hash is stored in `parent-cert-pin.hex` and enforced on all subsequent requests.

### Trust levels

Peers progress through trust levels: `unknown` -> `discovered` -> `registered` -> `verified`. Only `registered` and `verified` peers can delegate tasks.

### mDNS discovery

Edge nodes advertise themselves on the local network via `_secureyeoman._tcp`. Other nodes on the same LAN auto-discover and register as peers:

```bash
# Discovery runs automatically on start; no configuration needed
secureyeoman-edge start  # broadcasts and listens for mDNS
```

---

## Key Features

### Sandboxed Command Execution

Execute commands with allowlist/blocklist controls, timeout enforcement, and workspace root restriction.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18891/sandbox/exec \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "command": "df -h",
    "timeout": 5000,
    "workspaceRoot": "/opt/edge-data"
  }'
```

Symlinks are resolved to prevent escaping the workspace. Output is truncated at 64 KB.

### Interval Scheduler

Schedule recurring tasks of three types: `command`, `webhook`, and `llm`. Minimum interval is 10 seconds.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18891/scheduler/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "uptime",
    "intervalSeconds": 60,
    "name": "uptime-check"
  }'
```

### Outbound Messaging

Send notifications to Slack, Discord, Telegram, or generic webhooks. Targets auto-configure from env vars. The `GET /messaging/targets` endpoint returns redacted targets (URLs and tokens are never exposed).

### Multi-Provider LLM

Route LLM requests through OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or OpenRouter. SSRF protection blocks requests to private IPs (except Ollama on localhost).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18891/llm/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "llama3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize system health"}]
  }'
```

### Persistent Memory

Namespaced key-value store with TTL support, backed by a JSON file. Atomic writes via temp-file-and-rename. Limits: 1 MB per value, 10K entries.

```bash
# Write
curl -X PUT http://localhost:18891/memory/sensors/temperature \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "22.5", "ttl": 3600}'

# Read
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:18891/memory/sensors/temperature
```

### System Metrics

CPU, memory, and disk metrics are collected every 10 seconds into a ring buffer (1 hour of history). Available as JSON or Prometheus text format at `/metrics`.

### Capability Detection

The node auto-detects CPU, GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel), memory, architecture, and OS. A deterministic node ID is derived from hostname + architecture. Add custom tags for fleet filtering.

---

## Fleet Management

The dashboard provides a fleet overview panel at **Infrastructure -> Fleet**.

- **Overview cards:** total nodes, online, offline, GPU-equipped
- **Sortable table:** status, hostname, architecture, memory, GPU, tags, last seen
- **Auto-refresh:** every 30 seconds via TanStack Query

The parent instance aggregates metrics and capabilities from all registered edge nodes.

---

## OTA Updates

Edge nodes can check for and apply updates from the parent instance:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18891/update-check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The update process downloads the new binary, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and performs an atomic binary swap. The node does **not** auto-restart — leave that to your process supervisor (systemd, Docker, etc.).

---

## Security Considerations

- **Auth is mandatory.** Set `SECUREYEOMAN_EDGE_API_TOKEN` before starting. All endpoints except `/health` require a valid bearer token, compared in constant time.
- **Rate limiting** is enabled by default: 100 requests/second per IP with burst up to 200. Stale buckets are cleaned every 5 minutes.
- **TOFU certificate pinning** prevents MITM after first connection to the parent. Delete `parent-cert-pin.hex` to re-pin if you rotate certificates.
- **Sandbox restrictions:** Commands must pass the allowlist and must not match the blocklist. Symlinks are resolved before checking workspace boundaries.
- **SSRF protection:** LLM provider URLs are validated to block private IP ranges (RFC 1918, link-local). Ollama on localhost is explicitly allowed.
- **Secret redaction:** Messaging target URLs and tokens are never returned in API responses.
- **Error sanitization:** Internal error details are stripped from HTTP responses to prevent information leakage.

## TypeScript Edge Runtime

For environments where Node.js is available, a TypeScript `EdgeRuntime` exists at `packages/core/src/edge/`. It provides the same minimal footprint (config, logging, auth, A2A, task execution, health) while skipping brain, soul, marketplace, dashboard, and training subsystems. Targets less than 128 MB RAM and under 5-second boot.

```bash
secureyeoman edge start --port 18891 --parent-url https://hub.example.com
```
