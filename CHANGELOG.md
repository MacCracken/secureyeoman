## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-02-13

### Security Hardening
- **HTTP security headers** — All responses now include `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 0`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and `Permissions-Policy`; HSTS header added when TLS is active
- **CORS wildcard fix** — Wildcard (`*`) CORS origins no longer set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` (violates Fetch spec and allowed any origin to make credentialed requests); explicit origins now include `Vary: Origin` for correct cache behavior
- **WebSocket channel authorization** — WebSocket token validation is now properly awaited (was fire-and-forget); authenticated user's role is stored on the client and checked against RBAC `CHANNEL_PERMISSIONS` on subscribe — viewers can no longer subscribe to `audit` or `security` channels
- **WebSocket heartbeat** — 30-second ping/pong cycle terminates unresponsive connections after 60 seconds of silence; cleanup on server stop

### MCP Service (`@friday/mcp`)
- **Auto-token** — MCP service now self-mints a service JWT using the shared `SECUREYEOMAN_TOKEN_SECRET` instead of requiring a manually-configured `MCP_CORE_TOKEN`. No user intervention needed for local/internal MCP.
- **New package** — Standalone MCP (Model Context Protocol) service exposing FRIDAY capabilities as 22+ tools, 7 resources, and 4 prompts
- **Tools** — `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_get`, `knowledge_store`, `memory_recall`, `task_create`, `task_list`, `task_get`, `task_cancel`, `system_health`, `system_metrics`, `system_config`, `integration_list`, `integration_send`, `integration_status`, `personality_get`, `personality_switch`, `skill_list`, `skill_execute`, `audit_query`, `audit_verify`, `audit_stats`, `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_list`, `fs_search`
- **Resources** — `friday://knowledge/all`, `friday://knowledge/{id}`, `friday://personality/active`, `friday://personality/{id}`, `friday://config/current`, `friday://audit/recent`, `friday://audit/stats`
- **Prompts** — `friday:compose-prompt`, `friday:plan-task`, `friday:analyze-code`, `friday:review-security`
- **Transports** — Streamable HTTP (primary), SSE, and stdio (for Claude Desktop)
- **Security** — JWT auth delegation via core's `/api/v1/auth/verify`, per-tool rate limiting, input injection detection, secret redaction, audit logging
- **Auto-registration** — Self-registers with core's MCP Servers page on boot (including full tool manifest); deregisters on shutdown
- **Tool manifest** — Tools are sent during auto-registration so core can display them without speaking MCP protocol
- **Dashboard** — JSON API dashboard at `/dashboard` with tool/resource/prompt catalogs and logs
- **Filesystem tools** — Opt-in sandboxed file ops with path validation, symlink protection, and admin-only access
- **212 tests** across 26 test files covering tools, resources, prompts, middleware, auth, registration, transports, dashboard, and e2e

### Core
- **Auth verify endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/auth/verify` validates JWT tokens and returns user info; enables service-to-service auth for the MCP package
- **MCP tool registration** — `McpClientManager.registerTools()` accepts tool manifests during auto-registration; tools show in dashboard immediately
- **MCP server toggle** — `PATCH /api/v1/mcp/servers/:id` enables/disables MCP servers; disabling clears discovered tools
- **MCP storage update** — `McpStorage.updateServer()` method for toggling server enabled state

### Integrations
- **CLI adapter** — Built-in CLI / REST API now registers as a connectable integration on the dashboard; lightweight passthrough adapter with 100 msg/s rate limit (14 tests)
- **Generic Webhook adapter** — Outbound POSTs to configurable URL with optional HMAC-SHA256 signing; inbound `POST /api/v1/webhooks/custom/:id` endpoint with signature verification and UnifiedMessage normalization (23 tests)
- **Google Chat registration** — Google Chat adapter (previously unregistered) now wired into `IntegrationManager`; promoted from Beta to Stable (20 tests)
- **IntegrationManager.getAdapter()** — New method to retrieve the running adapter instance by integration ID; used by the custom webhook inbound route (2 tests)
- **Default rate limits** — Added `googlechat` (5/s), `cli` (100/s), and `webhook` (30/s) to `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMITS`

### Dashboard
- **MCP server enable/disable toggle** — Server cards now show a clickable enabled/disabled badge to toggle state via PATCH API
- **MCP responsive layout** — Server grid and header adapt to small screens with proper wrapping and truncation
- **Alphabetical platform sorting** — Available Platforms and Configured Integrations on the Connections > Messaging page are now sorted alphabetically by display name
- **Removed dead doc links** — Removed broken `helpUrl` links from platform cards (docs are not served by the dashboard); cleaned up unused `ExternalLink` import and `helpUrl` interface field

### Documentation
- **Integration guide updated** — Added CLI and Webhook setup guides with config options, inbound/outbound examples, and rate limits; promoted Google Chat to Stable; table now lists all 8 platforms alphabetically
- **REST API docs** — Added `POST /api/v1/webhooks/custom/{id}` endpoint documentation
- **ADR 025** — Architecture decision record for CLI, Webhook, and Google Chat integration completion

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-02-13

### Dashboard
- **Task History — heartbeat task visibility** — Heartbeat tasks now always display in the task list, even when no user-created tasks exist; previously they were hidden behind a "No tasks found" message
- **Task History — edit/delete for tasks** — Edit icon opens a dialog to modify task name, type, and description; delete icon uses a proper confirmation dialog instead of browser `confirm()`
- **Task History — responsive layout** — Table columns adapt to screen sizes with responsive visibility classes

### Fixed
- **Backend task update** — PUT `/api/v1/tasks/:id` now correctly uses an UPDATE query instead of attempting a duplicate INSERT which caused UNIQUE constraint failures
- **Date filter parsing** — Task list date filters now correctly parse ISO 8601 strings from the frontend; previously `Number()` coercion produced NaN which silently disabled all date filtering
- **JSON input safety** — Create task dialog and auto-create flow now guard against invalid JSON input instead of throwing uncaught parse errors
- **Type cast cleanup** — Removed `as any` type cast in task edit dialog

### Code Quality
- **ConfirmDialog usage** — Task deletion now uses the existing `ConfirmDialog` component for consistent UX instead of the browser's native `confirm()`
- **Test coverage** — Added tests for heartbeat task rendering (with and without regular tasks), edit dialog, and delete confirmation

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-02-13

### Dashboard
- **Task History — New Task creation** — Added "New Task" button with dialog for creating tasks (name, type, description, JSON input)
- **Sidebar quick-create** — "New" button in sidebar for fast access to create personalities, tasks, skills, or experiments
- **About dialog** — Replaced dashboard footer with About dialog accessible from user menu

### Fixed
- **Date filters on tasks endpoint** — Added `from`/`to` query parameter support to `GET /api/v1/tasks`
- **Auto-refetch duplicate tasks** — Removed automatic refetch interval that caused duplicate task entries
- **Notification toggle overflow** — Fixed toggle sizing that caused overflow outside container

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-02-12

### Dynamic Model Discovery
- **All-provider dynamic fetch** — Added `fetchAvailableModels()` static methods to `AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`, `OllamaProvider`, and `OpenCodeProvider`, matching Gemini's existing pattern; each uses raw `fetch` against the provider's models/tags API
- **Parallel provider fetching** — `getAvailableModelsAsync()` now queries all configured providers simultaneously via `Promise.allSettled`; models from APIs replace static lists while static entries remain as fallback on failure
- **Anthropic** — Filters to `claude-*` models via `GET /v1/models` with `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` headers
- **OpenAI** — Filters to models owned by `openai` or `system` (skips fine-tuned/third-party) via `GET /v1/models`
- **Ollama** — Lists locally downloaded models via `GET /api/tags`; returns model name and size
- **OpenCode** — Lists models from OpenAI-compatible `GET /models` endpoint with Bearer auth

### Dashboard
- **Dropdown highlighting** — Active personality and model selection items now show a lighter blue background (`bg-primary/15`) with a left blue border indicator for clearer visual feedback
- **Sidebar collapsed spacing** — Reduced spacing between navigation icons when sidebar is collapsed for a more compact layout

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-02-12

### Coding IDE View
- **Code editor page** — New `/code` route with Monaco editor (65% width) + embedded chat sidebar (35%); language auto-detect from filename extension; editor theme follows dashboard dark/light mode
- **Personality-scoped chat** — Sidebar personality selector (dropdown populated from existing personalities); selected personality scopes the chat system prompt locally without changing the global active personality
- **Send to Chat / Insert at Cursor** — Toolbar button sends selected editor text (or full buffer) as a code block to the chat sidebar; assistant messages include "Insert at Cursor" to inject code-fenced content back into the editor
- **Shared chat hook** — Extracted `useChat()` hook from `ChatPage.tsx` for reuse across Chat and Code pages; accepts optional `personalityId` for personality-scoped conversations

### Voice Interface
- **Speech-to-text** — Browser-native `SpeechRecognition` API with auto-restart loop for hands-free input; transcript feeds into chat input field
- **Text-to-speech** — Browser-native `speechSynthesis` reads assistant responses aloud when voice is enabled
- **Voice toggle button** — `VoiceToggle.tsx` component with listening (pulsing ring), speaking (pulse), and unsupported (disabled) states; available in both `/chat` and `/code` pages
- **Voice persistence** — `voiceEnabled` stored in `localStorage` key `friday-voice-enabled`; graceful fallback when browser lacks speech APIs

### In Our Image: The Sacred Hierarchy of Life
- **Sacred Archetypes** — Cosmological foundation (No-Thing-Ness → The One → The Plurality) baked into Soul prompt composition; every AI prompt now begins with the archetypal preamble grounding the "In Our Image" hierarchy
- **Heartbeat moved to Body** — `HeartbeatManager` relocated from `brain/` to `body/`, making Body the owner of the agent's vital signs; Brain retains memory/knowledge, Body now owns periodic self-checks (system health, memory status, log anomalies, integration health)

### Added
- **OpenCode Zen provider** — 5th AI provider using OpenCode.ai's OpenAI-compatible gateway (`https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`); supports GPT 5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 3 Flash, Qwen3 Coder, and Big Pickle (free); pricing, cost calculator entries, dashboard label, and unit tests included
- **Provider-aware model selector** — Dashboard model widget only shows providers with configured API keys; `getAvailableModels(onlyAvailable)` filters by env var presence

### Dashboard
- **Sidebar restructure** — User profile moved into sidebar with theme toggle and sign out; connection/live status indicators at sidebar bottom; refresh button beside title
- **Header cleanup** — Notification bell and search bar centered in header with improved spacing

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-02-12
