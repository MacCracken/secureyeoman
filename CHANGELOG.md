### Initial Release

F.R.I.D.A.Y. — **Fully Responsive Integrated Digitally Adaptable Yeoman** — a secure, local-first AI assistant with enterprise-grade protection and comprehensive observability.

#### Security
- RBAC (Admin/Operator/Auditor/Viewer) with role inheritance and persistent storage
- JWT + API key authentication with refresh token rotation and blacklisting
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with scrypt KDF
- Sandboxed execution (Linux Landlock, macOS sandbox-exec, seccomp-bpf, namespace isolation)
- mTLS with client certificate authentication
- 2FA (TOTP) with recovery codes
- Rate limiting (per-user, per-IP, per-API-key, global; Redis-backed distributed mode)
- HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- CORS policy enforcement
- Input validation and prompt injection defense (6 pattern families)
- Secret rotation with dual-key JWT verification
- Encrypted config file support (.enc.yaml)
- Cryptographic audit trails (HMAC-SHA256 chain) with retention enforcement

#### AI Integration
- Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI (local), OpenCode Zen
- Automatic fallback chains on rate limits/outages
